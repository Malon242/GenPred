HaruspexChexMix,"Ruby, trying out they/them after 4 years of she/her","Hiya, I'm Ruby. 4 years ago, I came out as a trans woman and used she/her pronouns but I'm really starting to think I'm actually non-binary. 

I think I still feel partially like a woman, but with a good helping of ""agender"" as well, possibly a demigirl/ nonbinary trans woman. I'd mainly want to try out they/them, maybe with she/her mixed in there too. For some reason, I've also found myself fixated on the label ""boi"" which I've seen both cis lesbians and some nonbinary folks use. I'm open to most NB labels like Enby and whatnot, feel free to use whatever you want as long as it doesnt have any ""male"" identity around it (like demiboy would) except for in the case of ""boi"". 

I like to make music, write stories, read comic books, my job (bartending), and martial arts. I'm also a big starwars nerd. My favorite movie is tied between Clue and Ex Machina, and my favorite games are A Hat in Time and Banjo Tooie. Currently playing MK11 as well.

Galactic-Dreams,"She, Her","I have stabbed her in the back and feasted on her soul
But she keeps coming back no matter how hard I hold 

I’ve wanted her end her life a few dozen times but for some odd reason I can’t do it even if I tried

I have hated and loved her, wondered what she might become, a monster like a me? A devil that speaks tongues? 

But no matter what I do to fend her off she keeps coming back with open arms, I scoff. 

That same grin, those tired eyes she loves me no matter what and that makes me want to cry.

I love her even though I’ve put her through hell
What was I thinking? Do you think she could tell? 

It’s easy using she like it wasn’t really me.

The person I hate the most resides within me. 

Her lack of vocab. 

The way she speaks

But all along I knew that I must stay with me

I hate it here 

Not the place, but the body I’ve been cursed with 

The way my hair never stays in place 

The way my hips sway 

Why must she be here?

Why can’t she go away?

Her uneven skin tone

Her voice of a man 

The way she can never make a decision even if death was at hand

The way she can’t convey emotion even in the darkest of times 

And how her trust in people always seems to be a crime 

This hatred within me never prevails 

I’m stuck within this shrine of who I used to be

Of who I used to love 

It may never be me 

She could end all my sadness with the swipe of a blade, one too many pills, or the tying of a knot 

But as long as I’m here the anger won’t stop 

But as long as I try to become my former self

She will always be here to help 

I will forever love her, I must 

But it can be so hard without dignity and trust

I know their are a few personal Critiques I have but I would still enjoy feedback from others :)

Nancy_Bluerain,"Couldn’t hurt, I guess. Let’s go with Nancy since it’s my username anyway, she/her, 31 mtf","Hey, peeps, just found this place and thought to give it a try. I guess it’s easier here, maintaining some anonymity as I would be terrified to do this with any of my friends and family is out of the question. At least for now.

So, I don’t really have a name, but Nancy is as good as any to give it a try. I’m 31, love driving especially long distances. I did name my car Nancy (hence the name), and she’s the most awesome lady I’ve ever known. She’s not just a car for me. She’s my friend too.

I love playing games, especially Elite: Dangerous and role playing. I also love photography and audio editing, cooking (though not very good at it), and going for walks especially on the beach, and the woods. Years and years ago when I was playing EVE online, I actually managed to fool everyone and make them think I was a girl. It’s was great, honestly, but it never had the courage to take it further. Though I guess I didn’t really take myself seriously either. Times have changed though, and I think it’s time to do something about it.

I’d love to try some conversation if that’s okay with someone, so feel free to ask me things as well.

Thanks 💙
And have an amazing day!"

The server owner asked if anyone saw any problems with this, so I thought that if there was a specific reason why pronouns are listed the way they typically are, I should show it to him."

My name is Daniel and I'm currently questioning my gender, and would like a little guidance. As of now I identify as non binary AMAB but something that recently happened has been affecting me and I can't seem to get it off my brain. I usually get referred to with he/they, but a couple of weeks ago someone used the she/her pronouns on an online game. I usually say I don't care what pronouns people use, but until that day nobody used she/her pronouns on me because I'm male aligned, and the she/her pronouns REALLY hit different. I always saw the words ""she"" and ""her"" as having some sort of \*energy\* that makes them special from other words, so when those pronouns were used about me, it felt kinda surreal. From that alone, I thought that I might be trans. The only issue is that nothing else about me makes me feel like I should be a woman. I'm nb but I present and act masculine, and I have no issues staying this way. I just have this irrational thing going on with the she her pronouns and I don't know what it means in terms of my gender. Does this mean it's just a pronoun thing, or is there something I'm not seeing as a whole? Thank yall, you are amazing :)"

MysticWolfShadows,Annoying Karen shouts at my older sister thinking she's her daughters Paraeducator (AKA: me),"So, I work for my school district as a para educator, and I work with kids one-on-one most of the time. Well, last month, I had to write up one of the first graders I work with for pulling the fire alarm for no reason. It led to the entire school having to stand outside for two hours during lunch, while the fire department came and tried to figure out what happened. So the kid got suspended, and she just came back to school last week. 

Well, apparently, her mom was not at all happy with the fact her kid got suspended. So she wanted to shout at the para who wrote her up. The kid apparently tried to point me out to her mom when she was getting picked up. Well, my older sister that lives across the country was in town for a wedding, and had been with me at the time, since we were going to an early dinner together before she had to leave for the rehearsal dinner. 

I ended up walking away, telling my big sis to stay put, since I just needed to go get my bag from my locker before we could leave. And the Karen had appeared almost as soon as I was gone, thinking my sister was her kids para. She started screaming at my sister, saying how her daughter would NEVER do such a thing, and how I was a lier who was somehow able to hate an angel like her daughter. Well, my sister doesn't know what to do, she doesn't have a clue what's going on, and they're starting to draw attention. Karen is still shouting, my sister can't get a word in, and other paras who are leaving are coming out and take notice. 

Thankfully, they're good people, and they jumped in to stop the Karen. Apearently being faced with more then one person was not what the Karen was planning, because she backed up and was given a verbal take down by three forty something ladies that don't take shit from kids, much less entitled Karens. That Karen ran with her tail between her legs, and was gone before I got back. 

My sister was super cool about it. It freaked her out at first, but she just brushed it off and let it go. She didn't even tell me until this morning when we went to breakfast before she left for the airport. Which is why I'm posting this now, with her permission of course. 

Thankfully, I haven't seen the Karen yet. I will update if she comes after me, though."
