sunflower-sundae,Im a 24 year old trans girl. Is it disrespectful to decline to dress in male attire and use my dead name and he/him pronouns?,"My family refuses to allow me into their home UNLESS I use my deadname and dress in male attire. I was told that it was entirely MY CHOICE and MY FAULT that I wont just do what they ask. But I dont feel like its appropriate to ask me to do those things? Ive been living on my own for a year at this point, am almost fully transitioned, and pass consistently in public."

Sincerely,
A pissed off Charlotte"

Galactic-Dreams,"She, Her","I have stabbed her in the back and feasted on her soul
But she keeps coming back no matter how hard I hold 

I‚Äôve wanted her end her life a few dozen times but for some odd reason I can‚Äôt do it even if I tried

I have hated and loved her, wondered what she might become, a monster like a me? A devil that speaks tongues? 

But no matter what I do to fend her off she keeps coming back with open arms, I scoff. 

That same grin, those tired eyes she loves me no matter what and that makes me want to cry.

I love her even though I‚Äôve put her through hell
What was I thinking? Do you think she could tell? 

It‚Äôs easy using she like it wasn‚Äôt really me.

The person I hate the most resides within me. 

Her lack of vocab. 

The way she speaks

But all along I knew that I must stay with me

I hate it here 

Not the place, but the body I‚Äôve been cursed with 

The way my hair never stays in place 

The way my hips sway 

Why must she be here?

Why can‚Äôt she go away?

Her uneven skin tone

Her voice of a man 

The way she can never make a decision even if death was at hand

The way she can‚Äôt convey emotion even in the darkest of times 

And how her trust in people always seems to be a crime 

This hatred within me never prevails 

I‚Äôm stuck within this shrine of who I used to be

Of who I used to love 

It may never be me 

She could end all my sadness with the swipe of a blade, one too many pills, or the tying of a knot 

But as long as I‚Äôm here the anger won‚Äôt stop 

But as long as I try to become my former self

She will always be here to help 

I will forever love her, I must 

But it can be so hard without dignity and trust 

‚Ä¢ Edit: Spacing 

I know their are a few personal Critiques I have but I would still enjoy feedback from others :)

So, I don‚Äôt really have a name, but Nancy is as good as any to give it a try. I‚Äôm 31, love driving especially long distances. I did name my car Nancy (hence the name), and she‚Äôs the most awesome lady I‚Äôve ever known. She‚Äôs not just a car for me. She‚Äôs my friend too.

I love playing games, especially Elite: Dangerous and role playing. I also love photography and audio editing, cooking (though not very good at it), and going for walks especially on the beach, and the woods. Years and years ago when I was playing EVE online, I actually managed to fool everyone and make them think I was a girl. It‚Äôs was great, honestly, but it never had the courage to take it further. Though I guess I didn‚Äôt really take myself seriously either. Times have changed though, and I think it‚Äôs time to do something about it.

idkwhattoputhere000,"My body hair isn‚Äôt masculine :) It is woman like, because I am a woman.","It‚Äôs alright to shave, I know some (straight) men who shave their legs and armpits. If you prefer that, go ahead.

But why is it EXPECTED from women to shave, wax, epilate? Surely the natural state of our bodies cannot be ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù, we literally are women. We grow hair. 

It is a way to control ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù, just like for example women in Asia were expected to shrink their feet. The meaning of femininity has changed so many times throughout history and differs in cultures and countries, but the want to control women has never changed. 
‚ÄúShave, be ladylike!‚Äù
Not shaving is.... natural. My body is ‚Äúwoman like‚Äù, because well, frankly I am a woman. Growing my body hair doesn‚Äôt make me ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù. And choosing to shave shouldn‚Äôt have anything to do with your sex.. but with preference.
That is as far as my opinion goes on leg hair and armpit hair.

But shaving & waxing pubes fully... and how normalised that is in porn? What the hell? Sorry but that one just makes me feel weird. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overreacting about this one though. Why is infantilisation of women normalised? Women aren‚Äôt children. Not to mention shaving everything off in that area is literally unhealthy. Why is making your pubic area look like one of a prepubescent girl considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù nowadays? It disturbs me a little. Same thing with the ‚Äúpornstar‚Äù vagina, through labiaplasty. Making vaginas look like small fully waxed slits because that appeals to porn sick men. Disturbing, I‚Äôm sorry."
whyisthatpotato,"I am a woman and part of my job is interviewing fathers on how to better include them in federally subsidized parenting programs, what I have heard breaks my heart.","I work in a psychology research lab that is paid to assess the effectiveness of federally funded parenting support programs for high risk families with young children. 

Right now, the focus of one of our current studies is figuring out how to make the programs more inclusive of fathers, as well as getting their perceptions of fatherhood in general. 

I conduct hour long structured interviews with fathers and it has opened my eyes to a lot of the male mentality around parenting. Many of them express to me that they dont feel welcome in these programs, that they are ""made for women"", despite many of them expressing a great desire to join the programs and learn about how to be a better parent. 

They also talk about the sexism present. Mothers must approve the father's involvement, even if they are separated. Many fathers also tell me about the culture of minimizing the importance of 5heir involvement with their kids. 

Overall, talking to these wonderful dads has made me both sad and hopeful. Sad that they feel excluded from something a woman would feel at home participating in, and sad that they cannot learn how to parent better without baby mamas approval. 
I feel hopeful though- many of these dads are extremely passionate about being good parents and just need better tools and teaching on how to communicate, listen and discipline effectively. Many of them thank me for taking the time to listen and caring about father involvement, and I am so happy to be a part of it."
sanahahsan,"This is the comment I posted last night on Sarah's IG and got blocked for. I am a woman of colour, silenced by a successful white woman.","""Sarah, I have been following your channel for a few years now, ever since your hormonal acne video. I'm sorry to see your campaign pulled and I'm happy to see that you and your team took a second look at your campaign. But I think as someone who has as big of a platform as you do, I would have hoped to see you use your platform to educate your audience. From the looks of it, your demographics are primarily white women from Australia and other countries. Let's face it, Australia is not that diverse of a country. There aren't many black people at all, and it's difficult for people to understand and empathize with black people and POC if they don't experience a relationship with them and don't get the opportunity to interact with them. Which is why I think someone who has a huge audience like you in a country that doesn't have much diversity, it's imperative that you USE your platform during this time to educate your audience and encourage them to educate themselves with what is going on in the U.S. Sure, your channel and platform isn't ABOUT activism and political issues and it might not be your ""job"",  but you have over 1mill followers who pay attention to you everyday. Use that to your advantage and speak up about the controversy you went through, what you're doing everyday to understand WHY you went through that controversy and why it is relevant and important. Rather than speak about your emotions and how hurtful and stressful it was for YOU to go through doing additional work and how you ""don't want to offend anyone"" and that ""you're not trying to play victim"". Talk about the pain black people go through everyday, educate your audience who may not be able to comprehend what is going on in North America. Your platform MATTERS right now. I hope you will use it. I hope you will take a break from talking about the house you get to purchase and renovate and understand your privilege and speak up about inequality. Encourage people to donate and to speak about racial issues in their home. You and Kurt are both compassionate people, please don't sweep this under the rug ‚ù§Ô∏è"" 


*I may be wrong about Australia and the lack of diversity, I don't know. But even so, Sarah should speak  to issues related to aboriginals  and diversity in AUS. I  know I had a roommate who was Australian and she flat out told me there are very little black people there and she was definitely a bit culture shocked coming to Canada.*


I also posted this, after realizing she deleted my comments: 

""To anyone looking to purchase her products, please also consider putting your money towards the #BLM movement and bail funds across the U.S. It's too bad that @whitefoxboutique didn't consider, especially after that controversy, that donating at least half of the proceeds of this launch would be a good move for their business."" 

Then I got blocked...I am devastated. I have been following her since Mitch days. I really liked her personality and used to say I wish I had a friend like her. To see her silence people who are asking her to use her platform and speak to issues that matter, really sucks. I feel ashamed for admiring her as much as I did. The fact that she is a mom as well...I expected more compassion and understanding."

I have had only a few male friends who play with me.. But today I was playing alone and was accused for anything relevant to the game (I was having most kills 4/1 while they were 0/2 or 0/3) they were saying  that I should leave them and stay in the kitchen, then they started to attack me saying why this new game go so wrong already is because there are a lot of women playing it... 
I just wanted to vent here, i feel bad and not wanting to play anymore even when that is what I want to do the most. But then again, i think about my dad and how he raised me, i should start getting to know other women instead of having just men to play.

cheeseheadno,I took shrooms and cried because I am a woman.,"Okay, so, dramatic title but hear me out haha. 

This past weekend, my SO and I decided to do some dispersed camping and brought shrooms with us. I‚Äôve only done shrooms a handful of times, but this was by far the best ‚Äútrip‚Äù I‚Äôve ever had. 

I‚Äôm on my period and I was thinking ‚Äúman, this kinda sucks that I‚Äôm on my period‚Äù ‚Äú....it‚Äôs a hassle‚Äù etc etc. but then I changed my perspective and thought to myself ‚Äúactually, this is the best time to be on my period. I‚Äôm out in nature and having my period is natural. This is me being in my purist form and my body is doing what it‚Äôs meant to do‚Äù. 

Of course my SO thought I was having a bad trip and immediately came to comfort me, which made me cry more because he was being so supportive lmao

Anyways, I just felt like that was such a liberating feeling. So much of the time I feel embarrassed about my period. I‚Äôm very open about it, but my family is very hush hush and conservative about something that is inevitable for me. Talking about this experience in a sober state of mind sounds so silly, but at the time it felt really important to come to terms with myself and my place on this planet."

danidiscovers,I am a woman with a long term boyfriend currently questioning her sexuality. Could I be pansexual?,"I've been with my boyfriend since I was 18. I am turning 24 now. He's my first partner ever. I didn't date before him as well. A bit more context:

1. I live in a heavily Christian country and am raised in a heavily Christian family. As in, I was valedictorian in summer bible camp kinda thing (yes, that was a thing). All my uncles are pastors. I grew up in the church.
2. Because of that, I wasn't allowed to date. It was a taboo topic in our family. No one talked about sex either except in the context of chastity. And I followed accordingly. I've always been a ""perfect daughter,"" so to speak. I did not have a problem complying anyway. I did not find anyone attractive. My older sister got mad at me for knowing what masturbation meant at 18 years old.
3. By 17, I attended university. It's a diverse, publicly-funded, and secular state university. I had my political and feminist awakening. I lived alone in a dorm. I stopped going to church. By 18,  I thought it was dumb that I wasn't allowed to date. 
4. The boy I'm dating now asked me out. I agreed. We've been together since.

Given that, I've never once questioned my sexuality in my teenhood. I have so many ""girl crushes,"" and I was aware of that. I am also VERY attracted to non-binary and androgynous looking people.  Then I realized it's heteronormative of me to take my attraction to girls less seriously and to just assume I am cisgender. 

I also considered that I'm bisexual, but I'm not just attracted to women/men. Truthfully, I'm attracted to more women/non-binary people than cis-men. For real. I did not have a high school boy crush that's memorable enough for me. I wasn't initially attracted to my boyfriend now until I got to know him. In fact, I would ask my friends if they found him attractive physically. They said yes. A lot of people find him attractive. I was the last one to see it. I love him though and I am in a happy and healthy relationship with him. Don't worry, he knows about all this. He also knows of this whole sexual awakening I am having currently.

It's a bit odd to start questioning my sexuality now because I am in a happy monogamous relationship. I understand that I am the only one who can tell, but I guess I also want to know if anyone here has had a similar experience as mine? Maybe if I find someone the same as me I can be more sure of myself? I just feel so odd sometimes. I just want to know that I'm not the only one running across the spectrum like this. And if anyone else shares my experience, what finally convinced you to start identifying as a pan?"

Why does that mean I automatically ""lose"" the discussion and can't be taken seriously?? If we are talking about a big ticket issue that affects people's lives and wellbeing, I might get a bit upset! But as soon as I get heated or begin talking with emotion I am shut down. I've been told to calm down, to relax, that I'm just an offended bitch, and so many other patronizing remarks simply because I have emotions. It really makes me upset. I am still able to have a rational discussion using logic and facts, and my emotions don't make what I'm saying any less true. But I often feel that as soon as someone makes me speak a little louder because of how I feel, all the men in the conversation will jump on me and make fun of me and basically end the conversation. It's so frustrating. You don't ""win"" an argument just because you've made me upset. Does anyone else share this feeling?

Edit: I do not mean ""emotions"" as in screaming or crying or lashing out. I mean facial expression, tone of voice, expressing concern or voicing an opinion that might be based in emotion but is relevant to the conversation."
GYUGGY678876,I hate how my culture holds me back because I am a woman,"I am second generation Pakistani female in the UK.

As a child, I loved my family. As an adult, I have grown to hate them.

Growing up, it was considered normal for my parents to keep me at home once I hit puberty, I was no longer allowed to see my friends after school. I was banned from talking to the opposite gender and feared physical abuse if I was caught. My sister was once found talking to a boy in school, 10 years later, my parents still don‚Äôt trust her. As an adult, I know I have to tell my parents exactly who I am going to meet, where I will be and I know my curfew is 9pm‚Ä¶ as an adult.

I feel a constant flood of anxiety before leaving the house to see my friends.  I am scared I will be stopped last minute because I did not cook or clean well enough so now I cannot see my friends. I will be berated for going out, spending money or not being at home to take care of household duties. I fear an extended family member seeing me outside the house and gossip going around the community about what I was wearing. ‚ÄúShe was wearing jeans, how shameful‚Äù ‚ÄúShe was wearing a mini dress, this is what happens when you let your daughters go to university‚Äù ‚ÄúShe obviously does not believe in God with the way she is dressing‚Äù

I feel guilty for my parents having to be shamed like that so I make sure to travel outside my city to see my friends instead. But then I feel burdened by my parents for not letting me live my life out of shame of what other people will say.

My parents control so much of my life. I am forced to be subservient to my brothers and father in the house. I have to cook, clean and look after them while I work a full time job. Due to the cost of a house, I am forced to live at home. I want my own property but it will be a few more years away till I reach that deposit goal. They plan on getting me married in that time, so there will be another man to take over the responsibility of looking after me instead.

I feel so much hatred and disconnect for my culture and family. As a child I refused to speak urdu so I would not have to speak my toxic extended family. I refused to watch desi movies or tv shows, and would secretly binge watch anime instead. I feel no connection to other Pakistani peers and avoid them like the plague, all my friends are from other ethnic groups instead.

But then I feel isolated at the same time. I cannot speak my mother tongue; I have no connection to a whole culture that everyone in my family participates in, while I watch from the side-lines. I dabble between the guilt of never being good enough to meet my father‚Äôs expectations and the rage I feel because of the role I am forced into. I keep telling myself, two more years and then I will have enough money saved up to buy a property, but the depression kicks in and everything feels so hopeless.

I have tried to fight back but my mother is an enabler of all my father‚Äôs beliefs. She cries to me in person about how miserable she is but then calls me selfish and ungrateful in front of my family.

I feel unheard, beat down and tired. Every day takes so much strength to live, I truly wonder how I have managed for so long.

Tldr;  fuck the partiarchy

&#x200B;

  

Edit: Thank you for all the messages. I wanted to make this post as a rant to anyone who felt the same and did not expect it to get so much attention. I am currently reading all of the messages, thank you for all the advice and sympathy. Everyone‚Äôs words have given me so much courage and strength.

Just to clarify my housing situation: As I am a recent graduate nurse working in the NHS, it is nearly impossible to rent, pay bills and feed myself on my current earnings, while living in London. I am willing to move to a smaller city but I will lose all my friends who live near me. My mental health is in a bad state at the moment and I am worried I will not be able to cope by myself. It is also a mix of my parent‚Äôs advice telling me to get a property as well. They are not wrong for telling me to avoid endless renting but I do understand it is a tactic to keep me living at home as well."

hygieia19,I am a woman seeking advice on how to heal and hone my divine masculine component of my soul,"I believe my greatest blockage in my practice in the occult and magick is that I never had a positive masculine influence growing up.

bio_ruxi,I am a woman and I absolutely do not enjoy receiving oral sex,"I am a 23 yr old female and I have had an active sexual life since turning 18. I enjoy experimenting with my sex life and I  like performing oral sex on my boyfriend. However, one thing that I never enjoyed is receiving oral sex. I have tried it with different partners but it just gets too overwhelming  very quickly. It does not hurt but it just feels a bit tingly and too much. My partners have tried applying various levels of pressure but nothing works.

I have to mention I don't enjoy directly touching my clit. I masturbate using a pillow. I orgasm fairly easily and often I have to make an effort to not orgasm before my sexual partners. I also cannot orgasm multiple times. 

I feel like my clit might be overly sensitive or something. Has anybody had similar problems? My boyfriend would like to perform oral sex on me and I just feel like I am missing out on a crucial type of sex."

I am very guilty of these things but I never show them, and I feel terrible because of it. I know this topic seems touchy to talk about, but I want to be brutally honest with myself because I feel guilty.

Sometimes I look at the most creative, talented, and successful people in the world and I see cis men and trans women. At this point, I  have come to where I don't think I will ever be comedic, smart, or logically charged enough to be anything even close to the people I idolize because I was a female at birth.

My brother teases me for not being funny because I'm a woman, and says that banter is something only men can do because women get offended too easily...

 And I mean... is he wrong? I don't think he is. If you ever say something out of the box that a woman will perceive as offensive to her (be it her looks, her smell, her job, or her beliefs), she tends to bet a bit defensive about it. ***I*** get defensive about it too (duh)! I don't know what it is, but it just makes me see my own gender as naive and hypersensitive. It seems like men will always be the ones trolling emotionally charged women (like me and most women) and laughing their asses to Hell whenever I feel hurt by some of their words.

And yes, I know that is a delusional and convoluted way to feel. There have been times where I have logically proven to myself that women are just as capable of men, then I feel happy for a sec like *yeah, I've been a boss bitch. I don't need to think of me and my fellow women as hypersensitive buzzkills who like looking pretty!* But then I get home and I read yet another tweet from an oversensitive white bitch named ""Ari"" or something who just couldn't take a joke well.... and I lose faith yet again.

I know I am needlessly attacking myself, but every day I wonder ""if I were just a guy, that joke would be funnier"" and ""If I were a guy, I would seem more strong and capable to my boss rather than cute and pathetic"". I don't know how to stop it and I have no idea how to feel more confident in my own skin. Does this make sense? I'm sorry if I have offended any women btw, this is more of a subconscious belief than a logical one. I am really scared to post this because I don't want to get flamed...."
Comfortable_Tadpole,AITA for asking to be charged for a man's haircut when I am a woman,"I am a butch lesbian and for the past 12 years I have had a short, men's style haircut. I'm not talking about a pixie cut that requires a lot of styling and time. My sides are buzzed fairly short with the top a bit longer. It usually only takes about 10- 15 minutes for me to get a haircut. During that time every salon I've gone to has charged me for a full price women's cut. This has always annoyed me and I don't enjoy paying almost double what men with the exact same haircut as me pay.

Recently I moved and yesterday I went to a new shop for my monthly trim and I decided to try something new. I asked if I could be charged the $22 for a men's cut rather than $40 for a woman's cut. The woman at the counter looked like I slapped her. She called a manager and the stylist over and they seemed shocked by the suggestion. They talked about it among themselves and then told me it wasn't possible. I pushed back and explained my reasoning and all they would say was they don't charge by style. 12 years of frustration boiled over and I ended up leaving. I was never rude or mean, but I still feel bad that I wasted a stylist's appointment.

AITA for asking? Leaving? Being annoyed at what I see as a double standard?

I've thought about going to a barber, but I live in a conservative part of the country and I worry about a negative reaction there and every salon I've ever gone to explicitly caters to men as well."

boyfriendsweatergirl,The shaming of men and their bodies needs to stop. I am a woman and I support men‚Äôs rights.,"I am a woman and I believe that the body shaming men have to deal with should be more talked about than it is. I believe in equality for people, but just one group. Race, gender, sexuality, religion, political views. None of those things should matter when it comes to human rights. And it is the right of not only women but also men to not be shamed for how their body looks. I always see media fighting against the shaming of women‚Äôs bodies and the sexualisation of women. What people don‚Äôt seem to want to talk about is that men are sexualised as well. If we don‚Äôt want to be sexualised, men shouldn‚Äôt have to either. Equality is a two way street. If women can fight back, so can men when the need occurs. If women get support when we claim rape, so do men. Men should not be silenced for having a penis, just like women should not be silenced for having a vagina."

Eventually I use the restroom.  Walking up I must choose.  For the first time ever (almost) I pick Female.  Three women in there were chatting and joking.  I joined their joking.  They continued laughing and chatting completely normally.

But there have been a lot of women who have done the same to men-- because we are all humans and we are all imperfect and some people just suck. 

But the men I hold dear--my dad, my brother, my uncles and cousins, my wonderful boyfriend, my fabulous boss, my male friends, some of my favorite teachers and professors--are so precious. There are so many lovely men in my life who are just trying their best, and I love them. And I think that most men are sweet and caring, and I have empathy and sympathy for the struggles men face.

Trans people have ruined so much, by taking our labels, and our spaces, leaving us actual women with nothing. 

I wouldn't have a problem with these people if they didn't invade our spaces, or demand we agree with their twisted ideology. I do not have to play along with anyone's ideology or beliefs. 

If you can't force me to abide by one religion, you can't force me to agree with your ideology. Trans people need to stop trying to force people to agree with them that they're what they say they are. Science proves otherwise."

ohwhatevers,I am a woman and I want to cum,"Reading this sub makes me feel inadequate about myself.

Who are these women who have multiple 30 second orgasms? Mine are single and last 2-3 seconds at best.
After cumming my vulva is overly sensitive to touch and stays like that for 20-30 min, so I can't imagine how I could ever have three-four orgasms in one sex session. 

I have never come from oral. It seems that all women love it and just can't get enough of it. Several partners went down on me during the past few years, it was nice and pleasant - but never even close to making me come. 

What is a vaginal orgasm? I looked for the g-spot many times, and it seems I must be missing mine. 

Often when I am rubbing my clit during intercourse I feel I'm getting close but then I sort of skip to the after-orgasm stage where any further stimulation is painful, without having cum. That is so frustrating.

Have to mention I'm taking antidepressants and I'm on birth control. I remember being more horny in general before starting antidepressants, however climaxing has always been a challenge for me.  

Is there anything I can do to improve my orgasming abilities? Toys, books, experiments - I am open to any ideas before I seek professional help."

**I am more of a sexist man than I am a feminist woman.**

So here's the deal.  I think this guy found my name through an old comment of mine in ask reddit where I shared my thoughts on how men are treated.  [Read the comment HERE.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/etb2od/78_of_the_suicides_around_the_world_are_males/fff5las/)

Anyway...  This guy sent me a message that started with the measurements of his business.  [Read the messages HERE.](https://imgur.com/a/pOTSTml)

Now I'd like to say something:  I am a woman in full support of men's rights.  Honestly, modern feminism has started to create a society where men are treated like garbage.  Feminism flies under the flag of equality when the real and obvious goal is domination.  My SO was a victim of this blatant attack on men.

Without too much detail, he went on a date in the past.  Things went well.  The chick liked him and things didn't go too far.  Long story short - The chicks friend was jealous because she had a crush on my SO.  Decided to falsely accuse him of raping the chick he went on a date with.  The college he was attending had to take it seriously and he was kicked off campus EVEN THOUGH his date flat out told them her friend was just being a jealous bitch.

But it doesn't matter.  He has a penis.  So the school ejected him under an NDA because they didn't want to deal with the embarrassment of how they handled the situation.

That's a bitch of a woman using her power to fuck over an innocent guy cause she's salty.

Women who treat men like that, women who equate men to their skill and cock alone make me sick.  I hate it more than I hate anything else.

Now to my point...  Men, if you present yourself in a message as your cock and only your cock NO WOMAN WILL RESPECT YOU.  I want to meet the mind and heart inside a guy, not his genitals.  My ex-husband had a VERY small situation but that's not what I saw in him.  I was married to him 5 years.  I was married to his heart, mind, hopes, and dreams for 5 years.  He only left me because we had a kid and that responsibility was too in the way for his music career.

Regardless, my SO now has the most incredible soul and intellect.  Yet, in public he gets treated as a utility or a pretty face.  It drives me up the fucking wall.  Men are so much more than that.  You guys are SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

**SO IN CLOSING,** don't approach women as JUST your cock.  The women who respond positively to that are not the women you want.  Ironically enough, the women who give you shit for it are the women you're looking for.

#TL;DR:  The guys who PM chicks right out the gate with information about their dicks are setting back everything you're fighting for.  Do something about it.

HellNoMIL,The first time I realized how differently someone saw me just because I am a woman. And I feel really self conscious,"I‚Äôm of the type that doesn‚Äôt dwell on negative experiences, if someone is rude I just roll with the punches. Like once in college I asked a boy to be my lab partner for our petroleum engineering class. He looked me dead in the eyes and said. ‚ÄúNo you look stupid‚Äù I am blonde. I was wearing my sorority jersey. And I am very bubbly. So I understood why he thought that and just got a different lab partner. I know I‚Äôm not dumb so I didn‚Äôt care. I liked the kid because he genuinely didn‚Äôt care about what anyone thought of him. He was there to be the top of the class and he taught me I don‚Äôt have to be liked to achieve my goal. (Ps I got the best grade in the class) 

I digress 

Last night my car freaked out in the highway so I took an exit and pulled into the first parking lot. It was a church and a cop was sitting in the parking lot. I called my husband to come get me. And the cop started to leave I flagged him down to ask if he thought my car would be safe here over night. 

He was a nice guy so we got to chatting. He was stationed in the parking lot until 9:30 so he didn‚Äôt have to leave and when my husband pulled up, we three continued the conversation. 

I noticed that the cop‚Äôs changed slightly when my husband came but I just wrote it off. He started mainly talking to my husband. My husband is in EMS so they were do a bit of shop talk, and I felt it is normal to try to engage the new person into the conversation. 

The cop said to me, ‚Äúya, you don‚Äôt understand the kind of stuff we see every day. We have tickets to the craziest show on earth.‚Äù

I responded that I‚Äôm in nursing school so I will be getting season tickets soon.

He said ‚Äúoh ya you will‚Äù he paused then remarked ‚Äúbut you should get a nice quiet job at a doctor‚Äôs office‚Äù 

I just mentally ‚Äúhuh?-ed ‚Äú then hugged my husband and said ‚Äúwell he is going to go to medical school so maybe he will hire me some day.‚Äù

We all laughed

But then the cop said ‚Äúoof sorry man, your gunna get no alone time‚Äù and started laughing some more

I stoped laughing and my husband started doing a ‚Äòthis is awkward but I will give you a chuckle for social pleasantries‚Äô 

The subject changed and at this point I was ready to be done with the conversation but the cop kept talking, and I had tried to mention we should deal with our car and ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want to keep you‚Äù but the cop said ‚Äú oh don‚Äôt worry about me I have to be here until 9:30 so you are just helping the time pass‚Äù 

The conversation continued for a bit, then I started to tell a story I was very excited about when the cop cut me off and looked at my husband and said ‚Äúis she always like this?‚Äù

My husband looked confused and said ‚Äúwhat do you mean?‚Äù

He said ‚Äú I mean, can she always talk like this üòÇü§£ü§™I‚Äôm sorry for you man‚Äù

I felt hurt and said ‚Äúhe loves it because he is a big talker too.‚Äù

The cop said ‚Äúhave you even taken a breath in the last five minutes üòù‚Äù

Then I said (like an idiot) ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm sorry I just talk fast when I am excited ‚Äú

The whole thing has made me feel so self conscious. And embarrassed. And makes me feel like I should be sorry for my husband just for dealing with me. 

The guy was just ‚Äújoking‚Äù but it still sucked

I know I‚Äôm on my period so I‚Äôm probably extra sensitive but it really has made me feel bad for who I am

Also things cop said ‚Äúah looks like the boss is here‚Äù when my husband pulled up and ‚Äúwhat do you think the problem is chief ‚Äú when my husband started looking at my car.

theres a girl who ive accidentally curved for two years (the first because i thought she was straight, the second because i was still recovering from a bad breakup with a guy) and ive finally talked to her and said yes, i like you. i really do like her. shes just what i look for. only issue is i struggle with overthinking and texting her first, replying in an interesting way, etc. she's been very patient, but god im terrible at texting women

SearchEngineJournal,I am a Woman in SEO: How I Create My Own Seat at the Table,
crediblemayonnaise,"I am a woman going to my first metal concert, probably on my own","(Apologies for both my English and formatting, English isn't my first language and I'm on mobile, also, pretty long so TLDR at the bottom)

 I(19F) need advice. I bought two tickets to one of my favourite power metal bands at the beginning of February. I don't have metalhead friends but thought I'd maybe find someone to go with in the meantime (I bought the tickets 4 months ago), so I bought two tickets instead of one. However, as you can probably guess, I haven't found anyone. I almost decided to ask my ex because he has been to metal concerts before, but I don't want to because I honestly don't want to remember the concert of one of my favourite bands with him in it. The only thing making me hesitant to go on my own is being a 5'2 woman, this being my first metal concert, and overall being pretty anxious about going to events on my own. 
On one hand I think going on my own would be a great way to bond with myself a little, and to have fun without being dependent on someone else I might not even like but chose to put up with because they are a metalhead.

Also, it's good to do things that expose me to places/events I would normally avoid going to on my own due to anxiety.

On the other hand, there are of course many things that could go wrong especially as a fairly small woman on my own. I haven't been to a metal concert so I wouldn't know what to avoid and when things might be getting bad.

My questions for you people is, do you have any advice on this? Whether it would be fine for me to go on my own? Are there things I should watch out for, things I have to take with me, things I should know about before going? 
I really want to go to this concert but going with people I don't necessarily like just because they are the only metalheads I know, or going alone and possibly putting myself in troubling situations is something I hope to avoid. 

TLDR: Thinking about attending metal concert on my own, asking if I should and if you have advice"

Low-Maintenance,I am a woman living in India and I am TIRED of hearing about another rape case every day.,"This past week has been depressing. It's been one news after the other about multiple women getting raped, and some were set on fire after being raped. What the hell is going on? We are told not to go out late at night because of the fear of being raped. We are told not to speak up if a man catcalls out of the fear of retaliation. We are told to dress modestly, because again...rape or molestation. We are told not to go anywhere alone, to keep an eye on our drinks at bars, not be ""bold"", not have multiple sexual relationships. When do I live my life? Will I live my entire life like this? Will I lie on my death bed thinking that I basically lived a life out of fear trying to follow rules that were made up by the patriarchy God knows when and because the justice system is inefficient? If I have a daughter, is this what she will have to live through not because all men are the same, but because God knows what if she trusts the wrong man or someone takes advantage of her?

Women have been raped even while being accompanied by a man, so there goes the logic of ""take someone with you so you won't be raped."" Young women, babies, middle-aged women, and old women have been raped...proving time and time again that age is not a factor. Most of these women were wearing traditional clothes which checks the SANSKARI NARI box, yet they were raped. Women have been raped by their own relatives. Women have been raped by politicians. Women have been raped by policemen. Police and politicians have refused to take rapes seriously. ""Come after you have been raped"". Women have committed suicide because the police refused to file a complaint. SO WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE???? WHAT is it that will make all these politicians sit up and think women are human beings too? That women are fucking tired of protesting and living like a second-class citizen that nobody cares about? And NO ""men will be men"". Women are just as interested in sex contrary to patriarchal belief, yet you don't see us out and about raping men do you?

Why are these politicians shying away from making rules that hand out strict punishments irrespective of their age? Why is our usually-talkative Prime Minister silent? Why are juveniles getting away with a few years? Rapists should be sentenced to death. If someone is capable of putting an iron rod up a person's private parts and/or setting them on fire and/or raping them, they deserve to have their balls chopped off and hung in public. Why are these cases taking years and years to convict rapists in cases with clear evidence? What's it going to take? I am so fucking tired."

I am getting so tired of consistently being undermined, ignored, or even mistaken as an administrative assistant.

italiangermanite23,I am in love with a gay man - but the thing is; I am a woman.,"Yes, you read that right.

Where do I even begin with this? Well, it all started last summer whenever he got a job at the same place I work at. I knew from the moment I laid eyes on him, I wanted to know him. We are servers at a restaurant, so it didn't take too long for me to get to finally speak to him. When I did, I knew why I was drawn to him. He is super intelligent, funny as hell, physically very attractive with a beautiful tattoo on his forearm. Being in such a ""work together as a team"" environment, we have had a lot of time to talk and joke around and \*attempt\* on getting to know each other. So after a little bit of the workplace shenanigans, one day he messages me asking him if I could possibly get him some weed (because we both smoke). I knew it was such an innocent message, but the thought that he thought of me made me so happy. I told him I could get him what he needed and we met at a place by where he lives. He asked me if  I wanted to smoke with him and I absolutely said yes.

That was the beginning of us ""hanging out""; but in my eyes at the time, that was more than enough. Just being around him made me so happy.

Anyways, as time goes on, we smoke together a couple more times and every time we do, I fall deeper and harder for him. But during these hang outs, I learn some things about him that I had previously suspected, but didn't know for sure. He tells me that he is bisexual (more towards gay) and has only ever been with other men. (Just putting this on the record, I am not homophobic in any way, shape or form. I completely stand with the LGBTQ+ community and do not mean to offend anybody from this post.) Upon learning that he has never been with a girl hurt me inside a little for obviously very selfish reasons on my part, but I completely understood it. Also during one of these hangouts, he told me he knew I liked him because of someone we work with and I chickened out and told him I didn't anymore like a 16 year old girl would do.

I consider him a friend now and we text/snapchat almost every day but the point being is; now I want more. At first, being his friend was great; hanging out, listening to music, talking, having a good time laughing and all that good stuff friendships have. Now, I want more. I want to be able to kiss him and hug him and fuck him and everything in between; even just laying down and cuddling would be amazing. I think of him way more than I should whether it be from the music I'm listening to, to seeing something that makes me think of him, to even just laying in bed at night fantasizing about him. He has said some things to me that make me think it could be a possibility for us to go beyond the friendship level, but never acts upon things he has said. Me, being a bit insecure and afraid of rejection is too scared to admit to him that I still do like him a lot. I know it's not hopeless because he said he is gay-bisexual, but that doesn't mean he is automatically attracted to me obviously.

littlehoneypossum,Mum being really unsupportive of business ideas because I am a woman.,"I messaged my mum today telling her about an idea I had for a blog/freelance writing business. For context, I'm 16 weeks pregnant and looking for work I can do from home once the baby is born, and my boyfriend works full time in hospitality. She responded with ""my deal was... if man work woman clean and do dinner...."" 

Well there isn't going to be any dinner unless we both work??

It's mad because she would never let anyone tell her off for not conforming to gender roles, but I think she has that kind of ""cool girl"" feminism, where you don't care how other women are treated so long as you're treated like ""one of the boys"". Does anyone else have this issue?"

Annae3,I am a woman but I'm not a feminist. Is there something wrong with me?,"I am kinda nervous about writing this post but there we go. Before I start I just want to make clear that I don't hate feminists, this post is about *me*. 

Well, I can't relate with feminism or any social movement. I don't usually say it loud to avoid unnecessary conflict but when I actually did I received dirty looks from feminists and heard phrases like ""all women should be feminists"" and ""there is no reason to oppose those who are defending your rights"". Excuse me but women shouldn't be anything. And when I say women shouldn't be anything I'm saying they have the right to not be feminists and this right should be respected! Also I thought feminists would fight for my rights too because I am a woman, even if I'm not a feminist. 

I just don't feel the need to be a feminist nor want to, I'd like to be treated as an individual with its own opinions. If I were a lesbian or a black person I would think exactly the same way. I don't like to be put in a box and told what to believe by both men and other women, that's why I left church.

My husband is my best friend, and the thought that someone could accuse him of rape, and get away with it makes me more angry than words can describe. There are bad people, men are not bad because they are men.  I am worried for men, because society tells them they're bad just for existing, that they can't even sit the way they are designed to sit.

lambychopp,I am a woman and oral/clitoral stimulation felt like nothing?,"Alright, I am 21F and just recently I met up with my long distance boyfriend and we didn‚Äôt have sex, but we did do oral and a bit of fingering. 

I am a virgin and this was my first sexual experience, so I didn‚Äôt entirely know what to expect.... but I‚Äôll be honest in saying that I really thought it would be a better time. 

(And it‚Äôs not because of my boyfriend I love him to bits and he was really trying here...) 

But for some reason I just could NOT have an orgasm. Not only that but I felt like I was completely numb down there. 

Idk if this is normal or not, but when he was fingering me I could just barely even feel him in me. Literally like it was numb. (Once I had a pap smear early this year and I also just felt nothing.. I was scared it would hurt but it didn‚Äôt feel like anything.) And when he gave me oral I could feel him there but I didn‚Äôt feel any pleasure... or I would for like a fraction of a second and it would just fade away.

He put his fingers directly on my clit, and literally I felt either fucking nothing, or just barely a little bit of pleasure. It really ruined the whole experience and made me so depressed after he left, and I just felt so bad because he was really trying but I just couldn‚Äôt do anything.

But here is the thing, he was rubbing me over my pants and it felt honestly pretty good. I am afraid that all the wet/sloppy kind of sensation is not enough for my clit or something.

When I masturbate, I tend to keep my clit completely dry and just rub it... and I am afraid I have messed up my sensitivity down there because I am so used to masturbating with roughness, instead of wetness if that makes sense... but when my clit is all wet, for some reason I just can‚Äôt get pleasure out of it.

I am just wondering if any other women have had this problem? Or if you were able to regain sensitivity after keeping your clit completely dry? 

Thank you."

Phychic_Killer,I am a woman who feels sexiest when I bleed.,"Maybe I am alone in this, and maybe not. Either way, I claim it now as my truth... 


I am a woman who feels sexiest when I bleed.


I feel sexiest as I sit bare-assed on my throne with a purple towel under my hips to catch my free flow during those first two days when my body rejects anything inside of me, and clothing seems like such a waste of good blood and laundry detergent.


I feel sexiest when I see the blood smeared across my inner thighs, painting the most tender and receptive channels of my body with the nourishment that is mine alone to share as I so choose.


I feel sexiest when I dance naked out under the dark moon, spiraling round with blood on my forehead and trailing down my legs to mark the grass with crimson tracks of where I've been as I sing songs of where I'm going.


I feel sexiest when the children ask me what's in the jar of red liquid sitting on the bathroom counter, and I tell them it's my yoni blood, the juice that flows from my body each month to help me shed layers of what's no longer needed so I can share that gift in holy communion with the Earth and my favorite houseplants.


I feel sexiest when my stomach is bloated and distended, shattering all of society's illusions of what feminininity is meant to look like and crafting the knowledge of what true Goddess is based off my own reflection.


I feel sexiest when I self-pleasure to relieve my menstrual cramps, again and again until the pain turns to pleasure and I remember why my spirit agreed to come into this body, custom designed for my mission to come home to myself as magic and remind others they can do the same.


I feel sexiest when I let my emotions flow as freely as my blood, my body grieving the loss of the life not yet to birth so that my attention and energy can be directed in fullness towards the mysteries I hold within, awaiting their time to come through. Blood mingled with tears, iron and salt, grieving the deepest aspects of my core wounds, my ancestors' core wounds, humanity's core wounds, the Earth's core wounds, releasing any sense of separation, of defining what's mine and what's their's, so that what needs to be felt, acknowledged, integrated, and released can find its healing through me.


Because I can.


And I do.


And that, I feel, is pretty fucking sexy.


Not alone. Never alone.

WhoseLineFan12,Fired from my job as a Plumber (I am a woman),"Hello, 

I was employed as a Plumber for 5 years by the same company (I am a woman, 33 years old - father owned a Plumbing company before he retired) and was recently let go due to what I believe is a sexist CEO who recently replaced our old one. I have never received negative feedback nor have I been written up - no client complaints. On the contrary, I was given very positive reviews from all my clients. I have held a journey license for just over 7 years and have over 3800 hours of training by a Master Plumber. 

The reason I feel I was fired because of my sex is because I came upon some work e-mails stating the CEO only wants male employees working on the Operations side of the company. He eluded to stating if any female staff are at the company, they should be at reception/customer service. 

The only reason I was let go is because of ""downsizing"" as the CEO said. Everyone else has kept their jobs. I am very upset and wanted to see if I can file some sort of Discrimination claim. I am in Maryland. 

Thank you!"

azertJ,"Today, I was seen as a potential danger for a man, just because I am a woman.","English isn't my first language, bear with me.

I'm a 20 years old woman and I went to see a doctor today. 
When I sat in the waiting room, 3 other people were waiting. A man was facing me and a woman + her son, who was maybe in his mid-twenties, were seating 3 seats away from mine. 
10 minutes in and the man is called by the doctor for his appointment. 
Now, there's just me and the woman + her son in the room. 
Soon after the man leaves, I hear the woman whisper to her son, trying very hard not to be heard ""you're going to be alone with her after, it's maybe better if you leave"".  
Being in a dead silent room, 3 meters away from them, I obviously heard. 
I was puzzled, not very sure if they were talking about me or about something totally unrelated. 
The woman then raised her voice to a normal level and said ""We never know"". 

Now at this point, I was thinking that the woman did not want her son to be alone with me in a room for fear I would accuse him of harassment, if not worse.
But I just blamed it on me extrapolating  from nothing and was trying to think of other ways to explain what she told her son. 

Then, they were called in the doctor's office, in which I figured they would go together. 
Except the woman went by herself and the son went out of the office, going out of his way to walk as far as possible from me while doing so.  He waited outside for his mother, for more than 20 minutes. 

What I assumed about the situation is very likely to be the truth. She didn't want her son to be left in a room with me, fearing I would accuse him of doing something to me.

I don't know their lives, what happened for them to be so cautious, but what I know is that it made me incredibly angry to be perceived that way. 
Very angry and very sad.

Just because I'm a woman, this mother perceived me a threat for her son. 

When I calmed down, I started thinking.
 As a woman, I also perceive men as a danger, most of the time. I always act out of caution, and go out of my way to avoid potentially dangerous situations, and all the women and girls I know have always done the same. It's always been like that.

But today was the first time I saw a man act towards a woman the way we act around men. 
It was the first time a man applied in real life what I see them tweet, that ""nowadays, men cannot be alone in a room with a woman because she will accuse them of rape and everyone will believe her"".

It feels incredibly weird to think that those men I was always taught to fear could take any kind of precautions around me. 
There's some cases of women falsely accusing men, of course. But often does it happen? Did it happen to that guy for him to not want to be alone with a woman? 

I don't really know how to put it in words, but I saw myself and other women in the way this man acted. The thing is, while I think it is very justified for women to act that way, I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that some men feel threatened enough by the cases were women falsely testify to take that kind of measures. Maybe I'm not very aware of the real number of cases, but in my mind, it is very minimal.
Women have always been called out for being ""overly cautious"" when they walk home or go out when there are countless occurrences of rape, harassment, stalking... But as soon as the medias shine a light on cases were a man is falsely accused, some men feel like they could be at an incredible risk. It's just very ironic to me.

I'm a bit frustrated because I feel like I didn't express what I'm feeling very accurately, but I just needed a place to talk about what happened today.

That's all. I just wanted to share this experience."

portcityonline,I am a woman who created a reddit alternative where harassment will not be tolerated,"Hi all, 
I created a reddit alternative which you can see and use here:
[portcity](https://portcity.online)

All people are welcome, but I particularly want to nurture the experiences of women, non-binary people and LGBTQ people. In other words, the kinds of people who feel harassed and shut down in other corners of the internet. 

I am a professional screenwriter and I created this space as a social network where people can connect and share their creative work and identities together. So like, you can create a sub for a project you're working on, or for a TV show you're a fan of. And each one has a chatbox you can chat with people on (like a messenger).

It's still very very early (and it looks terrible because I'm learning amateur web design!) But I wanted to go ahead and start inviting people because it's fun to work on a tiny social network with other people chiming in. 

I loved the way the internet used to feel before it became walled off into like four websites, and I think people want to feel that way again. Where you would eagerly log on to your private groups because you felt like you belonged there, you had developed close relationships and long-running conversations that felt real and important. That's what I'm trying to create. 

Thanks and love. x PortCity"

IlviSksln,I am stupid because I am a woman!,Sexism: My lab partner and I forget to write down our names on our reports. I got the one back which get the worse grade... But it was the report of my lab partner. Statement of the professor: It is not possible that a woman can be that good... WTF?! I really apologize that I do have a vagina!
bellaluna718,Giving you some parts of me. To show all I am a woman..,
beinglovedbyhozier,I am a tall woman. I regularly have people assume I am a man. I am at the end of my rope.,"I am a tall woman. I live in an area where women are typically 5 foot 1. My whole life people have said I'm tall so I don't have to worry about my safety, walking at night, getting raped, etc. On top of that, I have had people ask if I am male or female, assume I am a man, refer to me with male pronouns, subtly ask if my full name is the male version of my name (think Alexa to Alexander). I have large breasts and wide hips. It seems like there is nothing I can do to get people to not view me as a man or transgender person. I'm sure that I can give birth and still have people assume I am a man.

I get called sir, have people openly mock me as a ""t--nny"", people question if I am really that tall and look down at my feet. These are not compliments or people just making conversation. People literally ask me what gender I am, as if it's a mystery. I have a 25 inch waist and 38 inch hips and somehow people think I am a MALE! I have big boobs, somehow I am male though because I am tall? WTF?

I've had women stare at me in line at the bathroom like I shouldn't even be there. I am not a man. I was born female and have a period and have large boobs. I am not male.Tall does not automatically mean you are a MALE."
