I have built a couple skateboard cruisers and enjoy riding them around (I will occasionally hang out at parks and skate down small ramps but tricks aren’t my thing).  I got my major in history and I’m somewhat of an expert of medieval female mystics.  I’m super into sitcoms (Friends, New Girl, Parks and Rec, the Office, and Golden Girls are my favs).  I love rec sports and enjoy being fit (enough) but I also love ice cream just as much.  I’m currently in graduate school and am getting a master’s degree in college student affairs.

I technically have been questioning it for 3 or so years but in the past year started exploring my identity more and came out to a few close friends at school used they/them pronouns around them and lgbt spaces and it felt really nice. But now with quarantine, the only person I talk to that knows is my boyfriend, and he's amazingly supportive, but I never hear my pronouns because why would I. In general, I have no idea how out I want to be, but I don't think ill ever be completely out and tell my parents cause they honestly wouldn't understand and it doesn't feel worth it. But it does sucks to constantly be misgendered.

The problem is, its my very last semester of college and I start working a full time job a month after school's over. College just felt like such a safe place kinda removed from the real world where I could safely explore my identity and now I'm about to enter the real world so I feel like I missed my chance. And in general I don't have many friends so its not like I have many people I can comfortably be out to and explore how out I want be. The company I'm gonna be working for is a pretty big so I wouldn't feel comfortable coming out when I'm still not even used to being out as nonbinary. I feel like I'm just gonna be forever in the closet"

She lives in Europe, I’m in the USA, nearly all of our conversations are via FB Messenger. It’s not a whole lot, and we haven’t been able to talk much lately, so I actually forgot until she messaged me yesterday talking about me in the third person and she called me “they” instead of “she” for the first time and it floored me. It took me by surprise that she actually did it and after the shock wore off I just felt so... good. I asked her to do it because I wasn’t sure if I needed neutral pronouns, and because I trust her to not judge me in case I wanted to revert to feminine pronouns. I don’t. I don’t want to come out to the rest of the world about it either but it feels incredible to just know, you know?

I hate being in my own house and having my family tell me I'm a disgrace and how my generation is terrible. Without them even knowing. 

I have never felt comfortable with my genitalia. I have always viewed myself as having both or none. I have never felt comfortable with the idea of having one or the other. Recently its gotten so bad that I don't keep up with proper hygiene because i don't want to look at how feminine my body is. I wish my jaw line was more prominent. I wish my chest were flatter. There are so many things.

 I just. I struggle so much with telling anyone about it. When i was finailly admitting to myself that maybe I wasn't a girl, and I confessed to someone about it. He told me that he only believed there were males and females and that while he will always support me he didn't think that I should tell anyone else and that I was probably just confused. It hurt so much. But I understood so i tried to contain it all. Along with everything else I bottled up at the time. Eventually I told my mom how I viewed myself. I tried to explain that I didn't see myself in sexual acts or in non sexual acts with my parts. I tried so much to explain how I felt and hoped she would accept me. She looked at me and said that I basically wanted to fuck dudes with a strap on. And that's about when I didn't say anything for anyone for two years. Eventually. Last year. I felt like i found people who would believe me and accept me. I met someone who was non binary and someone who was trans and a whole bunch of people who did love me and i was really close with (a lot of said people were lost friendships that ended up rejoining because its highschool) I actually came out to people about it last year. And the small amount actually did accept me! They still used she hers but I figured since I didn't come out about it to anyone else that it was understandable.

And then I met someone really special. I had recently(at the time) broken up from a toxic relationship with someone who really drilled in that I was ""a girl who would never have a dick so why act like it."" The guy I met was and is absolutely amazing. He calls me by they all of the time. And always refers to me as his partner. I finally felt like someone accepted me. And then with this relationship I have. It slowly built up my self confidence and worth. And I told other people. Half would be very they/them and then some would struggle but always correct(I am not saying these people are worse than people who use they them without a second thought)and then there's people who say I'm ""too feminine"" or that I'll always ""be a girl"" to them or that ""they them is more comfortable for me to use with trans people sometimes"" but have them mock me for asking to be refered to as they them. Despite using it for other non binary people.

I finally have talked about how i feel in detail with a non binary/trans guy and I feel really valid? Affirmed?

They/he told me that I had disphoria and gender euphoria and that I was real. And it was completely normal for me to feel like that.

But. Being non binary is scary. Is terrifying. Knowing that I'll always be a woman or a girl in a ton of situations is scary. There will be very little opportunity for me to mark down my gender as non binary. Society wont  recognize me as trans. It sees me as worse because it denys me of existing. There is very little place for me to fit in. And I hate it. But its who I am and I cant change that."

lilahtort,Can someone give me the breakdown on non-binary? I am non-binary and have some dysphoria and I’m at odds because I still don’t understand it. Explanation in comments.,"Hi!

I’m 23/AFAB non-binary. 8i really, really would appreciate if at least ONE awesome person took the time to read this and respond.

And yet I don’t even understand what non-binary really IS. I know I feel it to an extent, as I feel dysphoria to an extent, but I’m at odds. And I’ll explain. Everything I italicize is going to include a question. 

Basic life story: was an extreme tomboy until I hit puberty. I mean, I really preferred to play with boys and boy things. *Dinosaurs and flinging mud were my shit, while dolls and dress up weren’t... at all.* but that doesn’t mean anything necessarily, or does it?

I was a very VERY awkward kid. My teachers wanted me screened for autism (which I believe I probably have but have never actually been screened so I can’t say I have it for certain). I remember going to the mall with my ONE female friend when I was 12. I picked out a giant baggy men’s band t shirt (I was probably a child’s large at the time, and I was picking out a mans large. I barely would grow more, maybe 20 lbs heavier, but I didn’t know that). She looked at me funny and told me to get one the right size and gender, and that’s when I knew I was sorta different “than other girls”. 

By 13 I was wearing makeup, not because I wanted to really but because it made me look older and get more serious attention I think. I remember hating waking up and putting it on in the morning but I felt like I needed to. I also subscribed to the “emo style” by this point. So dumb, but at the time, very depressed 13 yo me (who had like, nothing to be depressed about anyway) felt a rare sense of belonging.

By 14 I “looked” fully feminine. As a child I was pretty damn androgynous (short hair, baggy clothes, same clothes every day although that may relate to the autism stuff) but then I was wearing makeup and grew my hair longer and learned some more basic girl skills and hygiene skills (as a 12 yo I’d go A LONG TIME w/o showering or changing clothes).

This is a weird thing but by age *15 I could finally touch my own genitals and breasts*. And no, I was *NEVER molested as a child. I’ve spoken with my parents about this. I know for a fact if they knew I’d been molested they would have first off, told me, and secondly, killed that person.* But there comes the question. By age 15, I had probably had some semblance of a sex drive for half my life. Why couldn’t I touch my own vagina...ever? I had thoughts that somehow I was wrong and broken down there. 

I had fantasies of having a penis by this time also, and having sex with girls instead of boys. My first sexual experiences were with girls. We didn’t know what we were doing, really, but I know I enjoyed them immensely: thereby, making me at least bisexual because I like guys also.

Thing is, I’m 23 now, have fully accepted my sexuality and to a lesser extent my non-binary gender; but I feel almost robbed of it because it was never mentioned to me as a child. I struggled feeling differently for years, maybe partially because autism, but also from other women/girls. It was like bisexuality and gender didn’t exist to anyone around me. You were gay or straight. You are boy or girl. And trans people  exist, but they’re incredibly incredibly rare and you’ll maybe see one every few years (NOT THE CASE!!!!!). And maybe this is because my parents are really, 100% part of the binary. They’re great, really. But my mom never questioned her womanhood. She loved being pregnant (I would feel so awful and dysphoric being pregnant). She’s 100% straight, or so she’s always insisted (how?! I really don’t even see how this is POSSIBLE lmao!, I mean, when I was 11 my female friends and I were showing off and touching each others’ boobs and kissing, and while they may say it was a phase for them, it wasn’t for me!)

Anyways, 

Tl;dr: I consider myself completely non-binary but feel like a joke because from puberty onward I dressed up and wore makeup. Now people consider my hair (short, shaved) and my male dress as some sort of fashion statement, which makes me roll my eyes into the back of my head.

I’m terrified of being seen as a joke. I wish there was some way of “proving to myself and others” that I’m enby, but I know you really can’t and shouldn’t feel the need to.

But I never felt... comfortable in them. I hated looking at pictures of myself in make up or dresses or anything like that because it didn't feel right. It felt ... off. Like I was a lie.  


I kinda just chopped it up to me being ugly.  


Despite everyone telling me I am not.  


I loved wearing my army uniform. I loved wearing boots and heavy clothing and baggy stuff. I loved having short hair and little to no make up. It felt right. Again, I just thought that was normal.  


It wasn't until I met someone that had no ties to the LBGT community other than going to a gay/drag-show bar a lot telling me that I seemed... ""Fluid"" in the way I carried myself, that I realized... I might be non-binary. Hearing that, made me so .... happy?  


I still ignored it for years. Tried to be feminine and pretty and girly for my partners, because they always wanted someone who was fit, with big boobs... etc...  


It wasn't until... well... a few weeks ago that I said fuck it... I want to be me. I want to change my name. My pronouns... and the more I think about it, the more it feels right to be male, even.   


I am working towards that. Working on small stuff first. Getting a binder. Cutting my hair. Changing my name. My partner that I have now is super supportive, even helping me find binders and calling me by my chosen name and gender. It feels so freeing...   


I am lucky.  


I have met a couple of people who warned me ""Not to go down this path"" or who didn't understand/won't call me by my chosen gender... So I guess I have to deal. "

cold_blue_light,hey guys I finally decided to tell my parents I am non-binary and this was their response:,
thatonequeerkid,I am non-binary trans....Thing,"***OK this is my story of how i figured out i was trans and how i acted over the years. So first time posting, my first language is English.... I am just bad at it. :p Also i know grammatical errors i rushed this***

OK so lets start at the beginning, so ever since I can remember I have wanted to be a boy. But guess what I do not identify as a boy.

So in kindergarten I was kinda girly i liked skirts, buuuuttt I also loved sports and only playing with the boys because they did the things I like. I cant remember a lot about 1st grade, but I did always play with the boys like always. 

I can remember a lot about second grade, so I started wearing more masculine things usually(jeans t-shirts/graphic tees). I cut my hair to in like the middle of the school year. This one girl said i look like a boy which made me want to cry because i knew i was a girl because i was born one. (even though i wanted more masculine hair and clothes) i always wanted super short cool hair, but my dad did not let me, it took forever for my grandma to convince my mom to let me have short hair. Also I also tried to pee standing up a lot in second and third grade.

OK so third grade I would hate to wear dresses unless it was or special occasions. My hair kept getting shorter and shorter, and my clothes kept getting more masc. One time i even got some nice off brand Jordans'. Not much happened in third grade but ooohh did a lot happen in fourth grade. 

So in fourth grade i got a side swept hair cut..... kinda, but I bought myself some basketball shorts and always looked like a boy. When ever me and my family went to the mall i would play in the play area even though i was like 9 inches to tall, I always got asked by kids if i was a boy or a girl even though i did have a pretty big chest. Every time it happened it made me happy because i got to make some kid dumbfounded. 

OK last year fifth grade.. (yes i'm in sixth grade) In the summer of fourth grade June 2017 I thought i was genderfluid (gender changes) which is kinda right but not really. I got an actually side swept hair cut, really masculine cloths and in general just looked like a boy. I told my friends (2-3) that I was genderfluid not a big deal still used feminine pronouns even dresses sometimes. I did not have dysphoria at the beginning because i have a big chest for my age so i was like "" i have big boobs for my age i should be proud"" but when ever i look in the mirror it did not look right but i thought i was just insecure. (now i know that is not what it is)

This year sixth grade i changed my gender a lot... like a lot. So at first I thought i was genderfluid and would tell people who asked what gender i was each day. The I though i was a demiboy (partially boy partially nothing), then i thought i was FtM (female to male transgender) No like a lot of people in my class know i have no gender, i am also out as pan so you can see how much i get made fun of but i usually just put it off, I get called faggot/gay i don't really mind gay i just say ""only partially"" people say you were born a girl so you need to stay a girl. So i identify as transmasculine (transitioning to a traditionally masculine body but not FtM but non binary) I would rather wear a button down tie and jeans instead of a dress because it gives me social dysphoria, but maybe (probably not) at home by myself. I have dysphoria (gender and social) i came out to my mum as genderfluid like January but i am not any more so that is just.... yep. I bought a binder my mum has no idea because it came on a Saturday which is when everyone in my house was working :)))))) :P.

soysimonomisyos,"I recently discovered that I am non-binary. As part of the process of ordering my ideas, I wrote this short text that talks about my gender.","Androgynous has always been a concept for which I have been attracted and with which I have identified a great part of my life.

Although I have known the difference between gender, gender identity and sexual preference since time, until recently I was aware that they are totally independent.

Over the years, the list of male customs with which I do not identify has been growing. However, I had always thought, ""Ok. Men do this thing, but I can still be a man without having to do that"" as if first of all I owed allegiance to masculinity and not to myself.

It is much easier for people to accept someone of female sex exercising masculine customs than vice versa. This behavior not only overvalues ​​the masculine gender but is misogynistic in essence.

I find it very curious but also very absurd that there are only two genres. I think that this polarizes the gender problem, favors discrimination and limits the actions of people.

To experience my gender more freely, I intend to systematically exercise activities and behaviors independently of the gender to which they are normally associated with the intention that if I identify with any I can incorporate it into my day to day life."

whowhomever,Hello! I am non-binary :D,
Thisisnotidealsadly,For a long time I thought that I was binary. Now I realised I am non-binary and I don't like it.,I hate being non-binary. I am amab and transfeminine. Thought I was MtF for a long time. I already transitioned etc and now I realise I'm non binary leaning female. There is both a boy and a girl in me. The girl is a bit more present than the boy. HRT alleviated dysphoria and I have the body that I want. It's just I can't call myself a girl. It doesn't feel right. I belong in that grey space somewhere in the middle. Now I hate myself for not being a classic binary trans individual. It feels better to call myself androgynous than full blown woman. Here I am not being trans enough.
waddle-dee,I know I am non-binary and I am very depressed,"I am an assigned male but I know for a fact that I'm agender and not a male. I don't feel like a female either, most of the time I just feel like I'm a useless blob of flesh because I feel worthless.

I want to move out SO BADLY so I can dress how I want and and wear make up and not conform to these gender standards but I don't know if I will EVER have enough money to do so. I feel trapped, like I can't even express myself the way I want. I also have autism and OCD. I have struggled with my body for much of life and suffered from anorexia in middle school and early high school. I recovered from that but I feel extremely ugly and gross most of the time and I am extremely depressed. I am always tired and have started to hate going to work or going out in public in general. I have no friends either. I don't know where U am going in life I have no career in mind and can't handle going to college. Everything is terrible I have no idea what to I just feel like staying at home most days and not doing anything. I feel trapped.

The only  problem with it is that my niece who is 4 always asks me if i am a boy or a girl. I always hesitate and lead her off course and give her a roundabout answer. 

Is this gender concept to hard right now to introduce?

How can i help my sister (my nieces mom) with this topic and her kids?

Will my niece be able to learn new pronouns for me?

This is new territory for me and my family and I would love some advice on how to navigate this topic with family members especially young ones"
shaniacmaniac,I’m Non-Binary but still believe you need dysphoria to be trans!,"I am non-binary and have been for a couple years. I figured it out because how I was feeling. I freaked out sometimes because I was either too feminine or too masculine. I hated my breasts, and wanted them to go, so you couldn’t tell if I was a boy or girl. No, I don’t have dyed hair and piercings and call myself quirky. I find it stupid for anyone who’s transgender (ftm, mtf, etc.) to not feel insecure. It feels like they want just the attention. And it hurts for someone like me with dysphoria."
Stonks_Reddit,Well im a bit hurt,"I was trading like i usually do and i got a trade request. I accepted it because i had nothing better to do. The girl asks me if i have thigh high ice princess boots for trade and i said yes and placed them in the trade. Her offer was around 22k-28k and i had one of the items already so i said ""no thanks"" and declined the trade. She starts yelling at me and calling me a gay fag (i am non binary that was a girl but i think she though i was a boy because of the stereotypes and i was wear the woman body with boy hair). That really hurt me and then i snapped (keep in mind that for the most part a funny and chill person) and asked her: ""HOW AM I A GAY FAG?"" i really wanted to literally punch her for even guess that i was a gay fag (no hate to the gay men) but she left before i could say anything else.. The whole server saw the thing happen and no one cared that i was called a gay fag... This happen about a day or two ago and really hurt my feelings and i feel like i was somehow the mean one..

tl;dr a girl calls me a gay fag because i declined her trade."
din18rai,Anyone else look very Fem/Masc but still identify as Non-binary?,"Hello! I just joined this sub, but I wanted to talk to others who might feel what I do.

So I am Non-binary, but I present very Fem and I don't plan on changing anytime soon. I just wondered if anyone else expresses themselves in a very gendered way and has to struggle with not feeling ""Non-binary enough"" in Non-binary spaces?"
ahoohaahooha,Thinking of changing your name? Recently changed pronouns? Join my Zoom discussion group!,"I find that sometimes it's easier to try them out with strangers, see how it feels, or start talking with supportive folks for your name and/or pronouns to help it feel good, automatic, and like you. It's a neural pathway that needs to be formed, I've heard various estimates on how long this takes (66 days, 492 times, etc.), so let's start greasing that groove together!

I'm hosting a few Zoom groups meant for social connection of non-binary/GNC/trans folks, with the primary goal of allowing participants to try out or get more accustomed to a new name and/or pronouns.

About the meetings:  
\- Times/dates vary. My time zone is the Western US, but I'll try to find times that work for everyone interested, if they vary widely. I'm limiting these to 6 people per group due to the dynamics of group conversation. If there is wider interest, I'll make them ongoing.  
\- I'm doing this for free, so I'm using free Zoom which is limited to 40min per session. I will open a new room at the 40 min mark and we will all switchover. In total each meeting will be 80 min (1 hour 20 min).  
\- You will need to have access to Zoom.  
\- I prefer that everyone be on camera, but it's not required, as long as your audio is working or you can type in the chat.   
\- I know that some of us may have a few different name options we are deciding between. You can discuss this or your options in the group, but I ask that you please choose only 1 to be identified by for the duration of the meeting. Put it in your Zoom ID name along with your pronouns (I can guide on how to do this if you do not know).  
\- We will do a round of introductions with name and pronouns.  
\- I don't want this to be extremely structured or artificial, but in order to avoid Zoom Silence... I'll have a few prepared questions & conversation topics. Some serious, some fun, some random. I'll post them on screen share. We will go around & each person will choose a question, or create one of their own, & ask it to another person, using their name. Then anyone can comment on their answer, or contribute, being sure to use names and pronouns as much as possible. (E.g. ""Ash, what's your favorite food?"", ""oh my gosh, Riley, I'm having a similar experience."", ""I really resonate with what they were saying about representation & how meaningful that is."")  
\- Please come to the group with an intention to be mindful and supportive of everyone. Use their correct name and pronouns, they will be displayed on screen. Sometimes, even trans and non-binary people can misgender others, so if this happens, catch yourself, apologize, correct yourself, and move on.

Meeting with internet people will always carry some amount of risk. But some steps I'm taking to help with security:  
\- I am not posting this link publicly. I will only communicate date, time, zoom link, and room password in private messages.  
\- After someone messages me expressing interest, I'll vet by reviewing your Reddit history & ask you a few personal questions.  
\- Please be mindful of your personal safety. I know that so many of us are not in living situations that are supportive of this process. You can go do this on your phone in your car, outside, or while on a walk. You can use headphones on your computer inside & no one will hear people referring to you. If you need to duck out unexpectedly or turn off your video, that is ok.

About me:I am non-binary. I am queer. I am a student in a master of social work program. I've produced many in vivo events for my local LGBTQIA2S+ community. Although I'm usually behind the scenes, so we'll see how this goes. No, I don't have a post history on this sub. I'm a very active Reddit lurker. I learn most by reading about others experiences and reflecting internally.

stardustclub,Banishing my deadname?,"UPDATE:I took a bunch of your advice, here's what I ended up doing if anyone is interested! https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/grqiir/deadname_magick_update/
Thank you everyone who helped or showed support <333

Hi, I’ll try to make this as short as possible: I am non-binary and trying to move forward with my transition. I think I finally found the right name but for some reason I feel some sort of connection to my deadname, and not a good connection. It feels like it’s always dragging behind me and like I need to get rid of it before I can move forward with my new name. I was taking a shower and a thought just flew into my brain - can I banish my dead name? (Perhaps banish is the wrong word? I’m still learning the terminology and such lol) I don’t hate it or have any ill will for it, I just want to cut off any ties I have with it and leave it in the past. I’m a baby witch and have never done any type of banishing work so if anyone could give me some advice that would be much appreciated :)
EDIT: I believe in the rule of three, not sure what effect that would have if I decide to let my dead name go, but I’ll just add that in there for insight.
(P.S. I don’t have time for hate on my identity. I am who I am please respect that 💘)"
galadel,How to cut them off... I’m done with the toxicity.,"If it weren’t past 3:30am I’d probably have the energy to write a long winded post of all the reasons I want to cut my parents off, but the long and short of it is that I’m 100000% done with their Trump-supporting, racist, homophobic, transphobic, classist, ableist BULLSHIT. I am non-binary and bisexual and my partner is a non-binary trans woman and bisexual and we’re both still closeted to them. We do want to come out to them, even if it’s not the wisest. 

I just don’t know how to even initiate cutting them out of my life, especially since I am young (22), unemployed, and still relying on them financially (I’m still on my mom’s insurance, they pay for my car insurance and cell phone bill - off the top of my head). I’m willing to lose that financial support (even though I really need car insurance for appointments and returning to school in the fall) if it means getting them and their toxicity out of my, my baby’s, and my partner’s life. We’re currently living with my partner’s mom and stepdad who are breaths of fresh air compared to my parents. They’re even building us a studio apartment out of their garage for us to live in until my partner finishes her masters (she graduates undergrad in a couple weeks) and I finish school. 

Anyway, I don’t know what to do. Do I draft out a long letter? Do I send a short and blunt text that hints at more to come (I *do* want them to know all the reasons why I want them out of my and my family unit’s lives - that their behavior is abhorrent and directly negatively affects us). They’re expecting to come and visit us tomorrow to see the baby (and it’s my dad’s birthday) and I want none of it. I appreciate any help."

aleksritter,corset question,"i am newish to historical costuming and i know that corsets where used kinda as a bra but also to get like a body shape but right now i’m trying to make a 1885ish outfit so i’m making a chemise, drawers, petticoat, skirt, shirtwaist i probably won’t make stockings bc i can’t knit for the life of me but i am non binary and i wear a binder so i don’t have any breast so would a corset be necessary and if so does anyone have any patterns for how to make one that doesn’t really include like the breast part because i don’t need that i probably would just need the corset for like shape or something basically i’m just confused and i can’t find anything on the internet about this thanks


update: i still have a bit of time before i can even go out and buy the busks bones and eyelets (if you have recommendations on the best ones that i can get online bc corona please lmk) i will probably do an under bust corset and just make a bunch of mock ups and see what works best and i’ll play around with it and yeah for me historical accuracy is important for the silhouette if i need to make the corset itself less historically accurate so it works better for me i’ll totally do that bc no one will see it and and if they where to see it on me i should be far more worried about that then historical accuracy"
pinklasagna19,Considering going off of Testosterone after being on it for almost 7 years. What would change?,"Hey everyone. So I'm AFAB and have been on testosterone for nearly 7 years. I initially wanted a partial transition when I started transitioning in 2013 but was told that it was impossible so I made the decision to just go on testosterone long term because I was told that it was my only option. I identified at genderqueer for a while but my therapist told me that it sounded like I was a man since the things I physically wanted sounded ""male"" to her. So all in all, I was pretty ill-informed when it came to the nuances of gender by my doctor and my therapist. I went with it though and was happy for a while. But I have recently found that I don't identify as a trans man and that I am non-binary. I can't help but wonder how things would have turned out if I had had a better team when I was trying to figure this all out. I don't like being read as male. I miss being able to feel more androgynous in my gender expression and appearance. I'm considering taking baby steps like maybe trying to shave my beard and wear makeup and things like that. But I can't help but wonder, do I need or want to stay on testosterone? I was told I would have to be on it for the rest of my life and all this stuff but what if I just internalized what was expected of me and never really got to explore what would truly make me feel like me? There's no doubt I had and have gender dysphoria, but I feel like I still need to explore the idea that everything isn't so cut and dry for me or for anyone. I would love to hear if anyone else has had this experience. Thank you!

EDIT: I have had a hysterectomy and have had top surgery!

EDIT 2: I have read a lot of the comments regarding how you need to be on some sort of hormones if you no longer have ovaries. Would going on a lower dose of testosterone be possible or would it not really do much? Thank you to everyone who is responding!"
Panicking_in_trench,I'm a gender confused person who doesn't know how to express it,"I think I am non-binary, and I'm slowly starting to come out to friends (already pans so it wasn't too hard). 

However, I was born female with blonde super curly and poofy (think old fashioned white french wig curls) hair.. I have thought about cutting it super short through middle school but it would look horrible and not like an afro. Now I just like it a bit shorter than my shoulders. I am fine with my name, but to avoid misgendering I want to shorten it to Em.. How do I sort all of this out before I get redistricted to another school this fall, so I have a fresh start?"
iriris,Applied for my first job(s) need some advice on how to dress for an interview and how to go about introducing my preferred pronouns,"Hey all! I just applied for my first job, I applied at a cashier/customer service position at a frozen yogurt place and just as a backup I applied at a cookie bakery as a baker. I’ve never had a job before or gone through an interview so I’m very nervous. Any general tips and tricks for first interviews would help.

Additionally, I wear mostly casual clothing, my outfits are mostly t-shirts and skirts/jeans plus sneakers. Most dress pants are marketed towards men (I am a very petite non-binary person) and don’t really fit on me; hence why I favor black jeans. I was wondering if it would be considered unprofessional to wear a dress shirt, a tie, and black jeans with sneakers to an interview. On the other side, I could wear a dress with some more professional looking shoes— however most of the dresses I have are also a bit on the casual side. What kind of clothes (mostly referring to dresses and skirts) should I be aiming to wear in an interview? 

Additionally, should I disclose first thing in the interview that I am non-binary and prefer to go by they/them pronouns, or is that considered unprofessional/inappropriate? How would I go about introducing this? Unfortunately I don’t have any tag or clothing item that discloses my pronouns, so wearing a pin wouldn’t help. 

Thanks in advance!"
arbysbigmac,Gender dysphoria and the lines drawn in the sex spectrum,"to preface: I am non-binary AMAB, not intersex (to my knowledge), and started HRT a few weeks ago. I would really love to hear opinions on something though so I don't start saying something ill-informed when talking to other friends about intersex issues.

According to an informal theory put forward by Dr. Karissa Sanbonmatsu ([https://www.npr.org/transcripts/852274857](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/852274857)), gender dysphoria may have strong ties to hormone influenced epigenetic fetal development, specifically an environmental contrast between the first trimester when gonads develop/differentiate and second trimester when the brain begins to develop and create receptor sites with greater affinity for androgens or estrogens. 

Were this theory or something similar the basis of some gender dysphoria, tying it biologically to a phenotype of brain development that falls outside the assumed sex dichotomy, would you consider those cases of gender dysphoria to fall under the umbrella (or at least on the periphery) of intersex?

I guess I'm just wondering where those lines get drawn, if there are lines at all. All I know from my personal experience is that about an hour after taking my Estradiol, my brain feels calm and at peace for the first time I can remember and to an extent beyond what I could attribute to placebo, and I can't help but think there must be a biological basis for that reaction to switching up what hormones make it to my brain. If the sites of hormone production in the body are a sex characteristic, wouldn't the sites of hormone reception/reaction be as well? 

I'm not trying to claim an intersex label or anything like that, I'm just curious for opinions from folks who have a more nuanced experience. Thanks!"
GiftedString109,My siblings are living in an awful situation. Should I call 911 on my mother?,"Firstly, I wanna say I hate this so much. I love my family with all my heart and want nothing bad for them, but I'm considering calling 911 on my mother. 

Here is a little background information:

I'm 20 years old and am non binary. I have been at university for 2 years. I have a 17 year old sister and a 14 year old brother. About 3 years ago now, when I was a junior in high school, my was arrested for stealing from our local Walmart. She was giving my (ex) boyfriend and I a ride home from work (we worked in the same restaurant) and wanted to stop by walmart before we went home. We were followed by a lady with a camera the whole time and my mom just kept telling us not to worry about it. When we went into the parking lot, she approached us and said the police were on their way. My mom flipped her shit and told my bf and I to get into the car. She started driving away, but we only got about abblock before the cops pulled us over. It was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. 

My dad bailed out my mom and she had to do a bunch of community service and was banned from entering that walmart ever again. 

About a month later my parents decided to separate. They still haven't divorced fully but it's been ugly the entire time. I suffered a lot of ill mental health effects due to the stress that was put on me in the following year. I worked 40+ hours a week in a restaurant and went to cosmetology school full time. I paid for all my school and bought a car. I often helped with the bills, water, electric, etc. because my mom quit her job working as a teacher right after my dad moved out. 

I bought almost all the food in the house, cleaned all the time, did everyone's laundry, cooked for my siblings, and was basically their mother for a long time. It got to the point that I signed permission slips for school. When they wanted to go somewhere, they asked me. When they were hungry, they asked me. I reminded them to brush their teeth and helped them with homework. I drove them to school. I took them to doctors appointments and dentist appointments. When they needed lunch money or new shoes or clothes, I got it for them. I worked really, really hard for my junior and senior year of high school. 

All the while, my mom is drugged tf out. I never knew what she was on but she would go into these blackout rages where she screamed and threw things and hit us until she passed out. She never remembered it in the morning. I always did my best to get my siblings in our room so that I could try to calm her down but sometimes they saw it. 

Dad moved out almost immediately after they decided to separate. He took out their 401K and spent it all on a new house. It took him about 7 months to get fully settled and we (my siblings and I) didn't see him much, if at all, the entire time.

Things started to look up after that. Dad found a really kind girlfriend who made yummy dinners and played nice music during the day. Though it was weird in a new house with a new woman, it was 1000% better than what was happening at moms. 

We would trade off every week. One week at moms, one week at dads. One week at moms, one week at dads (well, my siblings did this. I lived in a dorm at uni during the school year and came back for summers and other breaks). We did this every week until my mom got evicted from the house about 4 months ago. It was awful. This was the house my grandma raised my mother in, it's the house my siblings and I were raised in. 

Well, after all this, my mom moves in with my grandma (the eviction happened exactly 2 days after mandatory quarantine was put in place by the government). My grandma helped my mom (who still hasn't gotten a job after 3 years except for when she was a bartender for about a month) take out a loan and buy a new house. 

We officially have this place as of 2 weeks ago and it's looking like it's going to be exactly the same. She has a 26 year old on-and-off boyfriend of 2 years who deals a lot of drugs. Mostly amphetamines, adderall, cocaine and weed. Im not positive, but I have good reason to believe that my mom is some sort of low functioning junkie. She manages to wake up and doddle around all day but that's about it. She hasn't moved anything into the new house except a mattress for herself. The only other stuff in the house is what came with it, like the fridge and the stove. Oh, and there is a lock on two cabinets and while I'm not 100% sure, I'm almost positive that's where her bf stores all of his drugs. 

This boyfriend shes been dating also has a very large and vicious pit bull who he has trained to attack anyone that isnt him. Its bitten children from just trying to pet it and everytime I come into the house, it barks and tries to run to attack me. If the bf wasn't there to stop him, I'm sure I'd be in the hospital. 

So obviously, I really dont want my siblings there. I want my mom to get better. The weird part of it is that it's like shes not even my mom. Shes like a whole different person. She offers me and my sister drugs and let's my sister spend the night at her boyfriend's all the time even though he is kind of abusive and very manipulative and my mom knows it. We've even talked about it. 

So my question is this: should I call the cops on my mother? I love her and I just want her to want to get better. It feels like she isnt even trying and it's very upsetting. 

I fear that one day, some one will come looking for her boyfriend and instead find my siblings. People around here have been known to break into dealers houses and hurt the people inside. I just want them to be safe while I'm at school. I feel like when they are there, no one is looking out for them. No one is making them meals, no one is making sure they brush their teeth and do their homework. No one is making sure they have lunch for the day or clean clothes. No one is watching out for them. 

I'm so so terrified of the possililities that could happen if I continue to sit idly by and watch my mother do this to us. I've tried talking to her multiple times and each time has been completely pointless. I'm so afraid. I'm so so so afraid. I dont want her to go to jail, I just want my siblings to be safe. What can I do? 


tl;dr my mom has been kind of absent for a while now. Should I call 911 so that my siblings will have to stay with my dad?"

saltycameron_,Accurately writing a trans woman character,"Hello friends!

I am writing a trans woman character in a one-act play and could really use some advice. Although I am non-binary, I am not a trans woman specifically, so I could really use some help with her portrayal and coming out, specifically. 

Context: two other (cis male) main characters are in a coffee shop when they spot the trans woman character, Victoria. The two other characters are trying to get in touch with a long lost friend who basically disappeared off the face of the earth and all social media, so contacting him via traditional means is off the table. They see Victoria, notice the resemblance, and wonder if perhaps he had a sister. They call her over and ask if she knows their friend, and she basically has to tell them that she does’t just know him, she *was* him at one point. Her friends are totally accepting and chill, of course, because who tf wants transphobia in their feel-good play?

Although a pretty minor plot point, I included Victoria’s transition to symbolize how the main cast have changed and evolved over the years of knowing each other, and to criticize the hypermasculinity of the industry in which they all met. Victoria is secure in her gender, however as a person/character she’s rather soft-spoken, almost shy. That’s one of the reasons why I’m having such a hard time writing her coming-out dialogue with the other two characters - she is shocked to stumble upon her old friends and afraid they might not accept her for who she is, but she’s still not ashamed of herself. But every time I write the scene I feel like an ill-informed cis person being all like “I am no longer Victor... call me Victoria” or something dumb like that lmao. Any tips on accurately representing trans women in my show would be much appreciated! Thank you and happy Pride!!

ETA that Victor is not her actual deadname y’all, I was making fun of cis ppl writing trans ppl lmaoo"
SliderGamer55,One year anniversary of realizing I'm non-binary,"So today is June 1st, happy Pride everyone! This day in particular is super important to me, because it was June 1st last year when I came to the realization I was non-binary. For the previous year before that point I had started to question my gender, but it was only on the basis of possibly wanting to be more feminine. But I'm not a woman (I'm AMAB btw), so that wasn't quite right. But Pride Month happening did make me think of non-binary, and when I did, everything started to click. And looking more into non-binary identities, I realized demiguy was what I was looking for like a couple of weeks later. Partially male, partially agender, that fits.

One thing that has come from this is a lot of doubts. I've had some doubt over my own identity, as much as I try to avoid it. Or to be more exact, trying to rationalize my own gender to myself has not been the best idea. It makes me feel fake sometimes. Right now, and maybe just in general, I am non-binary, demiguy because that's my gender identity. I partially don't want to even think about it beyond that. Granted, I've also been a bit slow at this. Like 7 months after, I realized ""oh, this means I'm queer, right?"" I'd never even considered that that word applied to me, somehow. I'm still in the closet IRL, so I don't know how my family would feel. I'd like to believe they'd be supportive, but I just don't know.

That's not even all my doubts and concerns, but none of that takes away how much better I feel just knowing my own gender like this. Just reminding myself I'm non-binary is a good way to improve my mood. Even closeted, I feel free compared to how I was. Like I never knew things weren't right until they were, I guess. I'm not even sure this describes how I feel vs how I used to before I knew, but its the closest things that come to mind that I can describe it as. Now knowing I'm non-binary, is the one upside of the otherwise meaningless, miserable, disappointing past 365 days of my life.

I'm really glad I made this post, I needed to talk about this today. And this was the most obvious place to say it so um...yeah. Was undecided between Yay and Rant tag btw.

Hope you all have a wonderful Pride month!"

vaguely-frog,How much bad behaviour and hurtful treatment should I [19 NB] excuse from my girlfriend [18 F] due to mental health issues?,"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for about 10 months now. We were very happy, and spending generally more than 12 hours a day together most days when we were both in college. At one point we were practically living together with how much time I spent at her place. 

Obviously that's changed with covid-19. Since entering lockdown we've both moved home and haven't seen each other in about 3 months.
 For some background information, my girlfriend has always mentioned that she had some issues in the past that did still trouble her to a small degree while we were in college. Also, I am non-binary which I really don't make a big deal out of at all, but there have been a few times she's told me she's not entirely comfortable with that which is still uncomfortable for me to hear. 
She also has a sort of compulsion to confess anything bad she's done, including random thoughts that cross her mind, dreams, worries, anything. 

Since entering lockdown, a lot of her problems have resurfaced and gotten worse. She has very common intrusive thoughts and anxiety over ""bad things"" she has done, felt or thought in the past, often related to sexual stuff, and these sometimes border on actual paranoias. She is deeply convinced she's a bad person and she admits she has had pretty low self esteem for a long time. I always listen to her when she's upset over these and try and comfort her. However she also had told me before that she often pushes away people who care about her when she's on her own and right now that's what's happening to me. 

If she isn't in the mood to talk I try and respect that, but we've gone from calling every evening to calling maybe once or twice a week. There are days when she'll barely message me and not tell me how she's feeling which makes me really worried about her. As well as this there are times when she gets very emotionally disconnected and starts messaging me stuff like how she doesn't care about anyone or how she doesn't love me or how she'll never be happy so there's no point even trying and she'll just leave me, et cetera. This is obviously not true and it's clear she's in a bad place but hearing that kind of stuff is still genuinely hurtful to me. She often says in these times she's not sure if she ever cared about me at all and stuff like that. As well as this there have been times she's targeted my gender including telling me she wished I was ""normal"" which was upsetting too. 

I can absolutely forgive her for all of this, but she's extremely bad at apologising and so far hasn't apologised for any of the things she's said to me while lashing out. I even recently asked her why she wouldn't and she said she didn't care if what she said hurt me. 

I'm a very patient person and usually try to defuse confrontation but this is getting really difficult for me to deal with. It's pretty clear to me she is currently depressed and has anxiety, as well as a serious complex related to sexual thoughts and feelings in general. I know she's going through a really difficult time and want to support her as much as I can, but she's refusing to let me. 

How much of this is stuff that I can excuse due to her mental health, and how much is genuinely her being shitty to me? And how should I act around this going forward?
I know I should look to receive the same respect that I'm giving but right now she isn't capable of giving that. What should I do? 

It's worth noting that it's not like this all the time right now, there are still times when we can have fun and have nice calls and make each other laugh which is getting me through this. It feels like they're getting less common though. 
She's also agreed to go to therapy once we go back to college, although that's not until September.
She also doesn't really have any other friends close enough to talk to about this stuff other than me which really isn't good. 

TL;DR: my girlfriend is dealing with mental health issues in quarantine, and distancing herself from me as well as lashing out to hurt me. I try to stay patient with her but I'm not sure how much of this I should excuse.

otter_fly,How to answer my niece when she asks if I’m a boy or a girl,"Hello Everyone,

I am having a bit of a dilemma with my family. I am non binary and recently came out to my family and changed my pronouns to they/them. The only  problem with it is that my niece who is 4 always asks me if i am a boy or a girl. I always hesitate and lead her off course and give her a roundabout answer. 

Is this gender concept to hard right now to introduce?

How can i help my sister (my nieces mom) with this topic and her kids?

Will my niece be able to learn new pronouns for me?

This is new territory for me and my family and I would love some advice on how to navigate this topic with family members especially young ones"
MelodyQuartz,"""Imaginary friends"" and Depression?","Warning mentions of self harm and suicidal thoughts! 







So I suspect that I might have depression. Honestly I suspected it since I was young. Recently I made up two imaginary friends by the names Charlie and Cameron. (Idk why they're the opposite gender then me but oh well.. I mean I am Non-Binary but as in my original gender.)

I need to mention that I was most likely parentified and never had my brother or my mom there for me emotionally. My dad was the only one who actually was with me both physically and emotionally but still couldn't be with me all the time since he works most of the day to keep our family going.

Charlie has a very overprotective and motherly  personality while Cameron has this tough and brother like personality.

I have seen Cameron getting hostile towards those he doesn't like (Or that make me feel I'm a negative way) but calms down after Charlie argues with him.

I guess I made them to help me with my depression since I have tried to self harmed before. They're more like voices in my head then visible characters but I know how they look. Kind of. When ever I think badly of myself or have suicidal thoughts or get mad I'll either be calmed down my Charlie or motivated by Cameron. 

I'm not sure if it's normal for me to do this but here's the shortest I could make it. Hope somebody knows if this is healthy or if I should be worried. Oof.."

now I have been close to coming out several times but ever since I was present at her conversation with one of my brothers about trans people, I have been very scared - they both said some very hurtful stuff (although probably because they aren’t educated on the topic, but still... :/) she also has been kind of obviously listening to such talks on the radio and on facebook. plus whenever she cuts my hair (I have had a kind of masculine/androgynous haircut for a few weeks now) she never fails to mention how *boy-like* it is and also adds that ‘but it looks great on some people’.

I have the feeling that maybe she’s trying to let me know? But it doesn’t help at all... :/"
Krab_Edge,I'm sick and fucking tired of being forced into a religion that prevents me from being ME,My parents are christian. I am Non-binary and I like guys. My parents don't know and its getting harder everyday to hide it. The constantly treat me like a piece of shit everyday. Wanting me to live life in their perspective without even looking at my perspective. I tried to tell my mom i'm an atheist and she didn't listen. I was reported to guidance at school for telling friends I wanted to kill myself. From then on I was sent to a psych ward. Even after that I still wan't to die knowing that ill never live life just being myself. They want me to be whatever they want me to be. Like i'm a fucking lump of clay. I know there are people with worse problems then me which is why I feel guilty about wanting to die. I can't control my fucking thoughts and it gets worse everyday. I go to sleep wanting to die. And I wake up the same way. I'm barely allowed to have friends and the only way I am really allowed is if they are from church or if they know them in person. It haunts me to think that religion may be a cause of suicide for being forced into it. It makes me wonder how many more people feel the same way I do. My parents have made homophobic threats towards other gay people and it makes me feel sick to my stomach that they may say that to me. They constantly make homophobic jokes that just amplify my anxiety and wanting to die. Comment if you go through this as well and also comment if you have any feeling about this yourself. Comment what you think would be the best thing to do. I really don't know if I can go much longer without just killing myself.

iwillgivecompliment,"How do you plan to raise your kids, gender-wise?","I am wondering how other queer people plan to raise (or have raised) their children in terms of gender.

Personally, I plan to raise my kids essentially without gender. By this I mean, I will call them by they/them pronouns until they're old enough to tell me what pronouns they prefer, I'll get them toys that they choose (ofc regardless of gendered marketing), and I'll try to make sure relatives and friends don't (mis)gender them until the kids are old enough to state their genders themselves. I'm sure raising kids \*completely\* without gender will be really difficult, especially since I live in the States where gender is so ever-present. But my main goal is to give my kids time to figure themselves out, and not put any expectations or assignments on their identities.

Not having kids any time soon, just thinking about the future. What do you all think?

Redpandas3,Pronouns/gender neutral terms,"I have recently realised I am non binary. Because of this I don't want to use she/her he/him pronouns. Most other enbys seem to use they/them however I don't particularly feel like they suit me if you get what I mean?? I am wondering if there are any other sets of pronouns that people use. As well as this what are some gender neutral terms for things like aunt/uncle, mother/father etc? Thanks!"
north_11,Genderqueer or Agender?,"I have recently done some research on gender and sexuality in the Lgbt community, so i could be informed of what it is and how I can support my friends and understand others more. Doing so, it felt like a world has been opened up to me. I've always felt trapped, wearing clothes that associated with my gender felt wrong, and whatnot.   


I have also came out to some friends and family that I am Non-Binary. But there is one thing that has been troubling me. I have seen that there are many terms under the Non-Binary umbrella, and noticed that Genderqueer best fits me. I feel as if i do not belong to being a male or female. But there was a term that seemed familiar to me, Agender.   


After reading different terms of what Agender and Genderqueer mean, I still don't understand the solid difference between the two. I feel as if I could be applied to one another, but I'm still questioning myself about it, but in no rush to figure it out.  


So my question here is, what makes Agender and Genderqueer so different from one another? Much love💕"
grey_writes_love,Is it transphobic?,"First of all: I am non-binary so I am not intentionally transphobic. 

I am a writer working on a story.  My main character is lesbian and has two love interests: a trans girl and a cis girl.  She chooses the cis girl.  The choice has nothing to do with the other girl being trans, but I am worried that people will be offended.  Should I change the plot so it doesn’t come down to trans vs cis?"
Gothy_Lassy,How did you know? So confused,"I have always felt like a bit of a ton boy. I am cis(ish) woman, but wondering if I am non binary. I am fine with being called she her, but I don't feel like I fit into the stereotypical idea of what a woman is. Like I am a woman but I'm not a lady. I can wear dresses but usually when I have shorter hair or combat boots or some way to make it less feminine. I have been fine it with, not really needing a label. But something I said recently made me wonder. I was talking to my fiance about how I wish I could just wave a wand and have a penis. Then save it again and have it gone. And not like a packet or strap on or dildo, that is basically the option I have now. But like a real penis. But not even to want it forever. Or be called he him. I am not sure how many other people felt like this. Doesn't everyone want to wave a wand and have another body part? I just feel confused."
LunaticMiko,Chest binding for extra large chest,"To start, I have been starting to realize that I am non-binary and I have chest dysphoria. 
 
I have been beside myself trying to find the right size binder. I tried 3 different sizes from gc2b. The 3x was too small, 4x was a little too big, and the 5x fit like a lose t-shirt. The other part of my problem is that I have size 40J/L chest and my breasts sag really bad which has made things hard too (Like they peek through the bottom) I can't just move them to the side, and the I still get cleavage. Is there other resources for binders that might fit better? Or would it have to be something custom?

I am going to start the process of getting top surgery soon, but in the meantime I would like something to help me feel better about my chest."
TotallyTaylor,Am I a “valid” AMAB enby?,"So I’ve always been interested in wearing skirts and dresses and watching and doing feminine things. And I’ve never really felt like a “man”, whenever my girlfriend refers to me as one it always feels weird. So I definitely have interests of both binary genders but I don’t like having my nails painted or my makeup done which I’ve seen a lot of AMABs do on here a lot of the time. Is it okay to still believe I am non-binary without doing conventionally “girly” things? I’ve only just started this journey yesterday so apologies if I seem uneducated or if I use any bad terminology, please feel free to correct me wherever necessary."
those-damn-teenagers,It’s strange to not want to date a trans person,"I always see people saying “oh I could never date a trans person” but the thing is, no trans person is the same. I get not wanting to date pre hormones/surgery or not wanting to date a specific trans person, but there is no defining characteristic that all trans people have. I get saying I only want to date gender-binary people, but not every trans person is all “UwU soft boi” or something. Saying “I would never want to date a trans person” comes from harmful stereotypes about trans people. Not every trans person is the same, and not every trans girl has a dick, and not every trans man has a vagina. Sure, if you don’t want to date trans people that have dicks is perfectly fine, that’s just a preference, and I’m not talking about that, I’m talking about saying all trans people do not fit your dating standards. 

Honestly if you say that you wouldn’t date a trans person I really don’t care, but I will judge you, because again, there is no characteristic that defines all trans people. 

This statement is just slightly annoying since I have many trans friends and I myself am non binary but I really don’t care all that much since there’s plenty of fish in the sea."
idoneedhelpsometimes,I (22NB) previously identified as a lesbian and am now crushing on a male person (25NB),"As a teenager, I struggled a lot with figuring out my gender identity and sexual orientation, which I at least knew were not cis/straight. I used to think of myself as bisexual for a while, but the questioning continued. This was accompanied and followed by a huge gender crisis. Let's just say that those years of not knowing who I even am were not fun. At one point I realized that I am non-binary. I've known this for quite some time now and have even outed myself to almost all my friends in the past two years. I've always been non-binary, I'm proud to be non-binary, and I don't identify as either a man or a woman.

Still, I've identified as a lesbian for the past couple of years. I think at one point I realized, that I don't have to like men. And I know that I definitely like women. This realization was incredibly freeing for me, and I felt really comfortable with the label. Still, I feel like adding that this happened at a point in my life where I was not yet comfortable with my gender identity and I really repressed that stuff for a number of years because it scared the hell out of me.

Having grown comfortable with being non-binary, I began questioning my sexual orientation once again half a year ago. I was afab (assigned female at birth), but I'm not a woman. I do like women, obviously. But I also find non-binary people very attractive. Genereally, I think androgynous-looking people are extremely hot. So... am I bisexual? I've never been with a man before, nor do I particularly care much about them, although I do consider some male celebrities attractive.

But oh wait, the headline! Yes I met someone and I've never cared about anyone the way I do about him. He's a guy, yes, but he also considers himself non-binary and goes by both he/him and they/them pronouns. And they're, surprise, bisexual! And I absolutely adore them. They're the first person that has me believing that soulmates are actually a thing. And he definitely likes me too, we just vibe increcibly well and love spending time together. 

And now I'm having the hardest time figuring out whether I like him like that or not. My thoughts on the topic that I share with my friends vary from day to day. But if I throw my thoughts in the trash and look at my feelings.. then it's clear that I've fallen for them.

So now comes the part where I ask you for some advice? I've never posted on reddit before and am used to falling for people I can't have, but I do feel like he could be worth the fear of putting myself out there?

\- Am I bisexual? I clearly prefer women and non-binary people, but that already makes for more than one (1) gender. and that's what bisexuality is all about. (I do identify with the word ""queer"" as well, since it opens things up. still, labels are kind of a big deal for me, otherwise we wouldn't be here)

\- How do I tell him I'm bisexual? Since they're also bi and non-binary, they would absolutely understand. But I'm scared that he'll immediately know that the reason I'm coming out to him is because I'm into them. And I don't know how to casually talk about **it** without talking about **us**.

 \- How do I tell him I like him? I know he likes me as a close friend (we joke about being soulmates) but I'm not sure he would want to be with me. To him (and everyone!) I'm still out as a lesbian (and, side note, being in your twenties and possibly in the closet again SUCKS). Since he's very respectful, I don't know if he ever even thought of me as a possible romantic partner. The last thing I want to do is ruin the friendship we have.

**TL;DR** I'm a non-binary sapphic person that's questioning if I am bisexual, I also have strong feelings for a queer man. Should I come out (to him) as bisexual? Or at least discuss my feelings, since he's an expert? Please give me some advice."

FabulousBookkeeper3,Hi I’m new here!,"Hi guys I’m new here and kind of new to the community. I figured out I was biromantic asexual (idk where on the ace spectrum I’m at yet) a couple years back after identify as bisexual for most of my teen years, I’m 25 (almost 26) now. I’ve always been distant from the LGBT+ community because many people didn’t seem to accept bi people. And as I got more comfortable with my gender identity, I am non-binary (she/her/they/them) I felt more isolated. Kind of felt more isolated once I discovered I was asexual. It’s been a journey trying to understand my own sexuality and how very different it is compared to everyone around me. I don’t know any asexual people around and there isn’t a big LGBT presence at my graduate school. So it’s nice to get a sense of community here."
B0GRP,I have finally accepted myself,"I am non-binary, I have spent so long fighting it and I made myself think I was going insane.

I was so happy yesterday that I was dancing around my bedroom and I couldn't stop myself from smiling, I haven't felt this good in a really really long time. I am so excited to hear people use they/them pronouns for me for the first time I can't even describe it. This all just feels so right.

shimonemo,I’m confused about my sexuality and was hoping for some advice!,"I am non-binary, and am currently questioning my sexuality, and was hoping for some advice or tips. I had always thought I was bisexual or pansexual for basically all my life, because I've had attractions towards both females and males, but these never went farther than a one-sided crush. However, except for that time, I've realized that my crushes on females last a lot longer than my crushes on males, with the latter usually only lasting around as few days to a week. 

I was also thinking, how in the 6th grade, for a class report paper, I chose to write about the topic of sexual assault, and learning about all of the details, going in to interview professors in the area and actual victims, and learning all the data at a young age gave me this fear of men, usually just a slight worry and fear in the back of my head, but can occasionally turn into a full scale panic when any man gets too close to me. This, along with my earlier statement of how I realized I really only have true attractions towards female, made me extremely confused on my sexuality, because I am not sure if I truly am not attracted to males, or if my brain is just telling me that because of my fears. 

Any help, tips, or advice would be seriously appreciated, and I apologize sincerely if I said anything to insult anyone in this text, it was not my intention. Regardless of whether you can/want to help, thank you for reading!"

KierNix,"I'm a pebble, dreaming about being a tree.","This is probably pretty common. I was raised in a cult with very strict rules and expectations about gender roles. I was born female, I am non binary gender fluid. I am single, 25, I have no kids and I work. All things that according to how I was raised means I'm a failure.

By 19 I should have been married, by 25 i should have 3 kids at least. And i definitely should not be working, because i should have been a stay at home mom. And honestly that is what I want to do. I hate the religion I left, it fucking sucks, but the one thing that actually fit was being a stay at home mom I really do want that. But because I havent achieved that yet I'm a failure to most of my family, just one brother and his wife and kids and one uncle I never talk to have also left that religion.

I have no schooling, no savings, a low paying job, no marketable skills for remote jobs besides customer service and call centers are literal hell. I have no prospects for a good future and its killing me every day.

I barely lasted a year at most of the jobs I've had. I worked 5 years at a hardware store, but it just about drove me into the hospital.

But the thing is, I havent actually contemplated killing myself since I was 14. I wrote a note, put it in an envelope and addressed it to my mom. Then I hid it, forgot about it and found a way to work through my feelings by writing fiction with a friend. Cue a year later when I found the note again and re read it to see how far I had gotten. The envelope had been ripped open and it was obvious someone had read it. At the first read through i didnt notice it, but then i saw in the margins a correction to a term i used. Someone had read this suicide note that wasn't dated so to them could have been very recent. And instead of trying to get me help they fucking corrected my grammar and PUT IT BACK LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. And to top it all off like a nice fucking cherry I recognized the hand writing because no one else in my family wrote that way except my mom.

What kind of fucked up person reads a suicide note from their child, addressed to them as the reason they want to die, and doesn't do fucking anything except correct their grammar. Did she want me to die? Did she want me to kill myself so that she wouldnt have to deal with me anymore?

I've cut her out of my life, it fucking hurts, but I cant live in her shadow constantly with her manipulation and underhanded attempts to make me rely on her for everything. But I'm still in a dark place.

I actually got suicidal today. I called out of work, because I didnt have the energy to do anything except cry about how useless I am. And I feel fucking guilty as hell and like I cant fucking do anything right. And all day I could hear her voice ""you should have gone to school then you'd have a better job."" ""You should have gone to the singles thing at church because then you would be married."" ""You shouldn't have cut your hair like that because now no one wants to be seen with you, especially me."" ""You cant leech off of other people forever, someday you'll need to prove you are an adult."" ""You shouldn't need meds to control your ADHD but you left Jesus so now it's your fault you feel like this."" ""If you hadn't gotten that tattoo you would be way better off in life, sinners arent winners.""

And it just goes on and on and it never fucking stops and I'm so sick of it I just want it to stop, but i want to shove it in her face when i prove to myself that i can be happy and successful without that horrible cult. But it feels like that will never ever happen and it feels like shes right and then a sentence that everyone in that cult says about people who leave pops in my head. I even said this when I was a believer. ""You'll come back. You'll realise you made a mistake by leaving. You'll come back, they always do."" And I want to go back. It would mean facing all the smug faces of my family as I prove them right. It would be so simple to go back and find a man who will marry me and give me kids, but I'll have to play 1950s house wife and be perfect and prim and proper and indoctrinate my kids into a religion that hurts so many people and act like I'm happy all the time and I hate the idea of that, but then how is that different than every single fucking day in my life where I put on my customer service face just so I can smile at my friends and family and they'll believe me when i say I'm fine, how are you.

If you read this far, dont worry. I'm too fucking scared of the void waiting after death to actually end it all, at least for tonight. I just needed to get this out and actually feel like it's possible someone will listen, even if they dont really care.

I'm empty, I dont feel good or bad about it all, I feel empty and I'm so ready to not feel empty but I cant seem to figure out how to make myself work like a normal person.

I'm stuck, like a pebble that dreams of being a tree some day, static and unchanging other than being worn down by storms and temperature changes, when really i want to grow tall, feel the sun, grow leaves and have little seedlings pop up around me and I help them grow. Itll never happen. I know I'm young, but at this point I can tell. It wont happen and I'm not sure why I keep hoping for it. I dont even know what love feels like.

Thanks for reading. I'll be fine for tonight. I sincerely hope no one feels like I do, I wouldnt wish this on anyone ever, no one deserves this. I know that's a hopeless thing to hope for considering the sub I'm on, but I still do.

Good night."

saphria1224,My younger sibling just came out as Trans and im conflicted,"I understand the sensitivity of this subject for some people. I want to outright state that I am non-binary and pansexual, so i have no judgement on this situation just yet. I want to acknowledge that i have some worry, though. I am going to use they/them pronouns and ill explain further. 

My little sister (now brother, age 12) has come out as transgender. I personally questioned myself when I was their age as well. The costs and cons of reassignment surgery and testosterone deterred me from transitioning. I settled on gender-fluid/non-binary as it fit me and my identity better.

My worry is that nothing of the sort of gender identity was a question until they had started talking to a girl online that was a little older and more knowledgeable about the LGBTQ+ community. I feel like they may be influenced in some way to feel the need. We were and are very close and theyve never mentioned anything about wanting to be a boy, other than cutting their hair to match mine (which i just thought was maybe their way of ""looking up to their big sister"" according to my mom).

Im not saying im against them transitioning whatsoever. I fully support and love them, and whoever they choose to be. Im just worried that they might be jumping the gun a little under peer pressure, which is what happened to me and i got attacked for it.

I just want some input, whether it be more information on reassignment surgeries, places or support groups to help them transition, personal opinions or stories, even similar stories. Im not really sure what im looking for in an answer here, i just wanna ease my anxieties and maybe change my mindset.

Please keep it positive though guys. Ill delete any hateful or transphobic comments.."

CupcakeJake,I've made a realization.,"So for the longest time I've been dealing with my gender. Back in highschool I was trying to figure it out and that was about six years ago at this point, but even before that I know I was dealing with it, that's just when I can really remember looking into everything. 
I've even came out a mtf transgender to two of my friends, but even then I really still wasn't entirely convinced. 

I've soon realized that I am non-binary. 
What really kept making me confused and going back to trans was that i don't like my body, I was born male and I don't much care for it. I do plan on starting hrt when I'm able to. I want to be more fem."

_catgotmytongue,"i (16NB), tucute, just found out my oldest friend (16M) is a transmed. how do i discuss this with him respectfully? [Family/Friends] [Coming Out] [Discussion]","so i’ve recently realised that i am non binary and am slowly coming out to the people around me. it’s taken me a while to feel comfortable expressing this publicly since i have little to no dysphoria (depending on the day) and really didn’t want to encroach on space that belongs to others. i do, however, experience euphoria and the more i allow myself to relax into gender neutral pronouns, the better it feels. 

this is my oldest friend we’re talking about. we went to primary school together, helped each other through some tough times (including when we were questioning our sexualities), and though we don’t talk as regularly as we used to we always do for the big things. i was one of the first people he told he was trans.

i feel sick knowing that when i come out, my friend won’t accept me. i want to talk to him about his views but am not sure how to do so in a calm and non-preachy way due to the really personal nature of the topic. i completely understand why his views are the way they are: he’s had a horrific time with his gender identity and just wants to be seen as a normal guy, not as a trans one. 

he views tucutes and non-dysphoric trans people as a joke who are preventing ‘real’ trans people from being accepted by cishet society. in the same post where he detailed this tho he expressed a desire for gender to not matter, which is what i view the tucute community for standing for. maybe this could be a point i raise with him?

i did plan on coming out to him soon, but seeing that post kinda threw me a bit. i definitely need to discuss this with him first. ideally i’d like to avoid coming out in the middle of a discussion like this due to the emotional intensity, however i realise he won’t be very open to discussing this with me if he thinks i’m cis.


tldr: my oldest friend revealed some opinions that i view as damaging to people in our community and mean he wouldn’t accept me if i came out to him. how do i open a calm and respectful dialogue (ideally without losing him)?"
gayjellysauce,my ignorant sister (and family),"i’m gonna rant about my ignorant sister

i recently figured out for myself that i am non-binary and i am not out to my family, only two of my friends and the internet

my family is super supportive of the lgbtq community (for the most part). i’m out to my family as a lesbian and everything is good. my mom even trains social workers and foster parents on the community, so she is very supportive and understanding. however, my sister is not so much.

my sister is supportive of being gay, bi, lesbian, and ftm or mtf trans. but she believes that there are only 2 genders. male or female, penis or vagina, xx or xy. that’s it. i’ve tried to tell her that she’s wrong but she won’t listen. i even sent her an instagram post about intersex people. she opened it and never responded. when i asked her why she said “sometimes i don’t respond to things for a reason” i asked if she even read it and she said no because she doesn’t believe that. she even said “i respect your opinion so you should respect mine”. the post had stats about intersex people and stuff. 

that’s not opinions, that’s facts and science. she is ignorant and won’t even listen to what i’m telling her. she won’t even see the facts about intersex people, never mind non-binary people.

it hurts me because she makes me feel invisible and like my feelings aren’t real. and yes, i’m not out to my family, but my cousin is non-binary and out to the entire family.

my sister and my brother still use their old pronouns and their dead name. my mom uses their new name, as well as my aunt who is their grandma. my mom still sometimes messes up and uses their dead name and i correct her when she does, and i get that it’s tough in the beginning. but even my mom, who is super supportive, doesn’t use they them pronouns for them. everyone in my family messes up their pronouns and i always correct them.

my cousin is currently living with their mom who has many mental illnesses, their dad is trying to get custody of them and their sister, but with corona it’s been really hard and both kids are super traumatized from their mom. because of their immense trauma, therapists and family believe that it is possible that being non-binary is a form of multiple personality disorder. even if that’s true, my family should still respect their name and pronouns, but they don’t. 

all of this hurts me, and hurts because my cousin is constantly getting misgendered and dead named by their family. my sister is the worst in all of this because she doesn’t believe that non-binary people are real. every time she says something about there only being 2 genders, it breaks me more and more because i feel like i’ll never be able to come out. my cousin is younger than me by a few years and they are already so much braver. i wish i were as brave as them. i know my mom will support me if i come out, but i love my sister and i know she will just ignore it. 

i’m scared that my sister will never respect me, call me by whatever name i chose, and use they them pronouns for me. even if she does when i’m present, i don’t think she will when i’m not there. and i don’t think my family would correct her. i don’t think anyone in my family would correct anyone else. even my mom because she doesn’t call my cousin by the right pronouns and sometimes name.

i’m just really scared. i’m really hurt by my sister. i would take any advice that y’all have. in a small conservative town, i should be used to this, however im still hurt by it. and because of the support i got when i came out as a lesbian, i thought i would be fine with being non-binary too. i shouldn’t have overestimated my family like that, but i did. 

sorry this was really long, but i have no one to talk to about all of this. thank you for letting me get it off my chest (like i wish i could get these titties off my chest) ((terrible joke but i needed to lighten my own mood)) 

thank you for reading if you did. any advice would be very much appreciated"

TotallyTaylor,Am I a “valid” enby?,"So I’ve always been interested in wearing skirts and dresses and watching and doing feminine things.

Im-Enby-lievable,Okay so y’all I’m gonna vent a little since I’ve just been enlightened,"So for a long time I’ve had a very negative outlook on feminism as a whole but mostly radical feminism. 2016 was a year where I was very fucked up and basically accepted everything in front of me.

#Internalized transphobia!!!

Here’s my main thing I wanted to talk about. I am non-binary, fairly androgynous, and use they/them pronouns. I was assigned female at birth. Now here’s where that internalized transphobia comes in, specifically to non-binary folks. In 2016 I was give a very wrong idea of what non-binary is and associate it with those female supremacists and SJWs. I still do. 

I often think that I’m stupid for thinking the way that I do and feeling the way I feel. I’m always afraid to sound like an SJW whenever I bring up non-binary topics. Every single time on reddit when someone asks my gender after talking, I have a mini heart attack cause they seem cool, I want to keep talking to them, but I’m terrified of what they’ll think. I’m afraid of what others think about my gender identity way more than I should be.  So tired of the “Haha do you identify as an attack helicopter?” shit, it makes me want to die

So long story short, Fuck 2016. It can suck my non existent balls. Feel free to give your opinions on Non-binary stuffs in the comments."
alfenbalf,Had my appointment with Dr Dundas today by Zoom,"So that was a thing! I was really impressed with him — I am non binary transmasc and just want a referral for top surgery. I was prepared for him not to really understand my deal or to ask intrusive questions about sex or whatever but he didn’t. I quite enjoyed the conversation actually! And he said he’d be happy to refer me pending a second opinion from Dr Lorimer. Now I just have to go and get a consult with a surgeon — whenever we all get out of lockdown, so that’s a bit anticlimactic."
silverrkoolkat,Any advice for my messily written problems?,"Hello! I am Non Binary and I have come out to only one friend.

MaleCJCregg,Non-Binary Revert,"Salaam alaikum. My name is Hasan, I am Non-Binary, 24, Lebanese/Palestinian, Autistic, and homeless in the United States. I am a revert to Islam, after my family had left the religion for safety in the post 9/11 for Mormonism wherein they became fully entrenched while I was able to escape in 2014. Due to the racism and Islamophobia, then followed by Homophobia by more conservative Muslims, I am not only having to relearn Arabic, but I am also struggling to learn all the aspects of Islam. I still pray as often as possible, but due memory issues due to Autism, I am just saying الله أكبر repeatedly and, due to homelessness, I am not able to do Wudhu Ablution as much either.   


Does anyone have any online resources that I could use to become a better Muslim. I'm tired of people telling me I am a horrible Muslim when I don't really have the resources to actually become better."
hellohappyme,"I'm non-binary, and also angry","I wrote this something earlier and I didn't know if I should post it, or where I should post it. I hope it fits here.

I think the problem that most people have with trying to grasp the existence of a gender outside of the binary is rooted in the same mental gymnastic that prevents them from understanding the most basic sufferings in life. No matter how ""woke"" you may appear to be, just like middle-class white Americans will never fully understand what it's like to be racially discriminated against, most people fitting a gender binary won't understand how current gender roles do not reflect whom some of us are.

The westernization of gender is the biggest step back. Whilst some countries around the world manage to keep elements of their thousand years cultures in their everyday life, the majority of the world remains westernized. Western ideals have often proven to be dangerous, and the same is for our view of sexuality, gender, and our binary understanding of everything.

It's very easy to see the world as black and white, or pink and blue. You're either this, or you're that. If not x then y. Spectrum only partially exists for some things, not the whole shebang. Scratch that.

Growing up, I quickly realised that the only limitations I had in my expression were the boundaries of my assigned gender at birth. I could only wear one type of clothes and had to fit with the rest of my group. Becoming a teenager, I learned about trans people -- I figured that it was probably who I was. It was difficult to get my head around that, too. There were so many things to do, going through HRT seemed like a mess. What if I didn't pass, what if people gave me looks everywhere I went?

It was only after coming out and starting to accept myself as transgender that I realised I was leaving one set of absurd limitations, from my assigned gender at birth, for another set of limitations put in place for the other side of the binary. How frustrating to question oneself as to whether or not I was cis or trans. Was I a girl, was I a boy? Who would even answer these questions if I can't even figure it out for myself, right?

After years of going back and forth in my mind, sometimes many times a day, ending up happy with my body then suddenly hating it with every fiber of my being because it didn't befit what I thought I should be, I came to yet another discovery.

*I am non-binary.

I've always been non-binary.*

I just didn't have the word for it. The sheer knowledge of my gender was hidden from me by thousands of years of discrimination against people like me, the millions of people like me, who continuously hate themselves before knowing who they are! All of this done by the propaganda of binary gender roles, set by scholars who were happy having their hanging dicks and receding hairlines rule the world, scribbling words through the centuries about who everyone is, and what they should be.

How often are we represented anywhere, and what kind of visibility does the knowledge of our existence have? Why have we been slowly dying of dysphoria for so long?

I am happy because I feel free now, but I am angry for all the people who are still suffering from everyone else. Just know that you exist and the only people who aren't valid are those trying to silence your presence into the world."
thoughtdestroyer2000,"What does it mean to you to be non-binary? ......and other questions from someone who just came to the realization that they are genderqueer. Somebody, send help!!!💕","*also posted in r/NonBinary*

First, a little about me. I am 25 years old, I live in the EU, and I was AFAB. However, I would describe myself as a woman (maybe female presenting is a better term?) and use she/her pronouns. Despite this, I have very feminine days and very masculine days. It depends on how I’m feeling in the morning. 

 For my whole life, I have been heavily floating between femininity and masculinity, and after some thorough research and a mind-blowing realization, I have come to the conclusion that I am non-binary....or at least I was until I read so many different definitions of what it means to be non-binary/genderqueer. So I’ve got some questions:

1) What does it mean to you to be non-binary? ( I have read so many different definitions of what it means to be non-binary/genderqueer. As soon as I read one definition and I’m like, “Hell yeah, this is me,” I read another one and go, “Hmmm but that doesn’t quite describe my feelings...” I prefer things to be very straightforward and defined, but this is way more dense than that.)

2) Have you ever worried that if you came out to your friends as non-binary/genderqueer, they would view it as a gimmick or say that, “It’s not real”? (The few friends my introverted self has managed to scrape up are extremely supportive and loving, but I still worry about what they will think.)

3) Attention Non-Binary/Genderqueer People Like Me (i.e. AFAB, female presenting): Have you had issues with people perceiving your non-binary/genderqueer identity as “not as valid” on days when you choose to present as female/femme?

I definitely have more questions, but let’s start here! Answer one question or answer all; any help or answers are greatly appreciated! 💕🥰"
SaintSolAndTheDragon,Avoiding binders while still wanting top surgery," 

(Cw: boobs) 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hi, everyone! I am non-binary, and has identified as such for 4 years now. Only last year did I figure out that I want top surgery, mostly because, prior to that point, I thought that only binary trans men could get that surgery in my country. I got my first binder (gc2b) a few months later. However, as I read up on the physical side effects of bindning, especially long-term, I got scared. I didn't want to risk chronic back pain, constricted breathing, bruised ribs, and especially not worse skin quality and saggy boobs, even if I binded safely. It should be noted that I'm a huge perfectionist, with OCD, and the reason why I don't want saggy boobs isn't because of female beauty standards (since I'm not female, of course, and the tiddies are going away anyhow), but because I'm afraid of that loose, damaged chest skin quality and stretched areolas will affect my top surgery results, which is my worst nightmare. So, I have been avoiding binding with a binder as much as I can, with only wearing it a few minutes at a time, even though I feel absolutely amazing in it. I instead use sports bras, layered (stretched and loose) bras and oversized clothing, but those methods don't do enough to hide the bumps, and every time I look down and see them, I feel miserable. 

So, to recap, I don't avoid my binder because I don't feel that I have a need for it, I absolutely do, but because I'm so afraid of that using it long-term will give me physical complications and affect my surgery results, especially since I can't get top surgery for at least another year. If wearing a binder long-term didn't have any physical side effects or risks, I would wear it constantly. However, even though I know all this, it still instills doubt in me. ""Most other transmasc persons use a binder while they wait for top surgery (if they want it), and they're valid af, so this means that you aren't valid enough / your dysphoria isn't bad enough to have top surgery,"" and so on. So to you all, my question is: is it valid to not want to wear a binder when you technically can do so, and still want top surgery?"
Ooooby,Hmmmm,"I don’t know how many of y’all have seen it, but there’s this cool sub called r/egg_irl, which I found funny for a bit, although I know I am non binary. I guess I kinda feel like an ‘egg’ but for being nonbinary. I know I am, I’ve accepted it, and stuff, but yet I still doubt. It might just be my environment or something but I don’t know. Does any of y’all feel the same."
Suchdarlingwrecks,Struggling with gender identity,"Hey friends! 

I’m on r/nonbinary too but recently discovered this sub. I’ve been struggling with my gender identity a lot, and it’s taking a toll on my mental health. I am grateful that I have a very awesome and supportive counselor, but I’m still struggling.

It’s hard to know if I am non binary or just maybe gender non conforming? I have a lot of turmoil surround this. I am AFAB and love having buzzed hair, wearing a binder, and being perceived more androgynously. I have thought about a breast reduction too (not sure if I want top surgery but I’m still figuring that out, so right now I think a reduction is what I’m interested in).

I am okay with she/her I think, but terms like “girlfriend” and “daughter” make me feel a bit ick, so that is confusing. I’ve considered they/them and a more neutral name, since my birth name is quite feminine.

It’s just hard to sort out what is my gender expression and what is my gender identity. I’ve also been surprised at the invalidating attitude of other members of the LGBTQ community, which I don’t think is helping me. I have found a lot of support too, but the negative voices are tough to ignore.

Any advice or insight is very much appreciated. I’m really struggling and I’m not sure how to figure things out. Thanks friends."
redditor-with-editor,Hi everyone!,"Hello! I am non-binary, and my pronouns are they/them (kinda obvious). I have recently came out to my friends, all of them being very supporting.

Gallantpride,"I don't like using the term ""identify""","It's almost always used towards trans people, not cis people. Many cis, and even some trans, people use it as an excuse to misgender you.

QuadrupedsRule,I did my first shot of T this week :3,"In my early thirties, non-binary, AFAB. I got my prescription in November but didn't start it because I was in the middle of a unusually long depressive episode (like, 2 weeks already). FF to now, seems I am still in the depressive episode. Doc upped my antidepressants to the highest dose possible and both they and my friends, most of which are trans or queer, said that taking T might actually help me with energy. So I did it! I did the think. I did the subQ needle thing in the tiny amount of fat I was able to get purchase on from my abdomen. 

I'm on .1 each week. I am not transitioning. I am non-binary, gender is a social construct, etc. 

I would love to hear/make friends with anyone else in this position, or who is or has taken the same low dose as me. I have no idea when to expect any changes! It's terrifying, exciting, exhausting and liberating all at once. 

I haven't told my family and I don't intend to. They have always been supportive of me in my tomboy-ish-ness as a kid and they are supportive of me being queer. They were supportive when I cut all my hair off. I just don't want to tell them, I guess, because I don't think it's anyone's business but mine. I live far away from them (\~5000 miles) so they are more like permanently-attached strangers than friends. I have told my friends. They are supportive and I love them. I am worried that if I continue to take T that I will have to at some point explain it to my family because... it'll be pretty obvious.

xboxBOND,The world is actually against me,"Hello. For context, I am non-binary and currently living in the U.S.

If anybody has been paying attention to news about religion, which quite a few are, multiple stories have come up. These include a law that involves giving people who practice certain religions extra rights that others don't have, laws that openly make life difficult for LGBT people like the law in TN, and even the fact that being LGBT can be penalized with death in countries. I have to be afraid at this point because people like Mike Pence and Donald Trump are currently trying to reduce LGBT rights in many ways, whether it be forcing people to go to conversion therapy, being discriminated against 48% of Christians which is a real and very concerning statistic, or just killing people for living the way they do. On top of this, I live in a very christian neighborhood and I'm afraid that if I'm outed at all, bad things will happen.

tl;dr: people are attempting to allow religion and other things to dictate LGBT people's rights."
