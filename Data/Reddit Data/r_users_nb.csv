DarthKookies,"I should be able to use ""they/them"" when referencing someone whose gender the character/reader is temporarily unaware of - without any guff."," 

Maybe I just don't know a better way to do this, but I'm tired of fishing around for ways to describe or write someone who (for the moment in the story) is temporarily genderless.

Either the character interacting with 'them/this person-thing/it' (see what I'm getting at?) doesn't know yet, or can't tell, or whatever. It doesn't matter. I sure as hell don't want to use the word ""it"", when most cases the 'it' will be clearly humanoid, or a human. Perhaps the individual in question has a male or female voice, but it doesn't matter. Depending on the species, THEY could be male or female.

I get bogged down in my own work, and when I'm reading, with too many 'he' and 'she' floating around for the sake of proper grammar (which I am no master of, myself). Sometimes I find myself having to re-read a sentence or two because I have no idea who the 'he' or 'she' is referring to. That takes me out of the story, and reminds me that I'm reading, and that I lost track of the subject, or who or blah blah blah.

""A shadowy figure appeared in the distance, and upon my viewing them I was taken aback by how fucking scary they were."" IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? Clearly the they and them are referencing the 'shadowy FIGURE', not 'figureS' Sounds better to me than 'it' or 'upon viewing the figure' or some convoluted attempt to describe it/them with too many words that bore me and bog me down.

This is a cry for help. I want to use They and Them to describe a single person. It's not that confusing if the sentence is done right. It's not like the reader is going to get up in arms wondering where a group of people came from when before there were just two. It's not that hard.

On my 6th draft, going crazy. Thanks."

RabbitRedux2020,"I think the pronoun ""they/them"" is a load of bullshit","Before I begin, this is a throwaway account. And if those were someone's chosen pronouns, I absolutely would use them with them and when referring to that person. 

But I still think that the pronoun they/them is bullshit. I totally accept transgender people, as there are two binary genders and if you feel you are not male and actually female, I wholeheartedly support that. And vice versa. 

To me, they or them refers to a group of people  or animals/insects. It is a word used to describe living beings in a group or groups. Not one, single being. A group. 

Whenever someone refers to themselves as they/them, I just think ""ok so you're calling yourself a group. Cool. Cool"". 

I wholeheartedly support LGBT people, being one myself, but this they/them business is one of the areas where I draw the lines there really isn't a tertiary set of genitals that correspond to a third gender. If there was, all power to you and I'd accept the they/them business. But as it stands, generally people are born either male or female (I am aware of the complexities in situations such as being intersex brings and that it isn't always clear cut in instances like that, but they do tend to live life as either male or female). There is no third gender.

If you're they/them or nonbinary, I'll happily use the pronouns you want and stand corrected in your eyes if I get it wrong in front of you. I wouldn't misgender you and will use your chosen pronouns when I talk about or refer to you in person/conversation.

But I will always refer to you as he or she, him or her in my mind."

iontophoresis2019,Using they/them to refer to a single person is stupid and confusing.,"I don't know why gender activist wants to use them/they to refer to them as a single person. Its gramaticaly incorrect and causes confusion for someone non-native who only learned english in school and by reading lots of books. I'm not really good in grammar, but using them/they to refer to a single person is an obvious grammatical blunder. I tried to read much about the topic, but i really couldn't get it. So for example, when is say ""let's watch Sam Smith, I love them songs"", english teachers will accept that as correct?!? It's pretty obvious that it's wrong. I really don't know what's wrong with people nowadays. I'm from south east asia, my parents invested lots of money for my education and my effin english teachers are so strict about grammar. Now i'm living in the US and all I see are artist going about an obvious grammatical blunder. The sad thing is, when you're incorrect, they'll accuse you of something you're not."

Moonfrog11,A mom asking for advice on they/them pronouns,"I have an amazing child (13) who has recently come out as trans. Eldest was born with a female body and asked for a binder a few months ago. Eldest says they have girl days and boy days and days that don’t feel like either.  Eldest prefers they/them pronouns. 

Dad and I are super supportive- we are looking for both mental & physical health care providers that are supportive of Eldest and are open to the journey ahead - wherever it leads.

Unfortunately, I am having a really hard time with the pronoun switch. Both of our kids have gender neutral names but since they were toddlers, I referred to them as Miss Eldest and Mr Youngest. <facepalm> 

I’m also a huge reader and a grammar Nazi so I have a hard time with the singular to plural transition.  It may have been easier for me to change pronouns if it was ‘she to he’ but ‘she to they’ really messes with me.  

Someone gave me the recommendation to think about how I use pronouns when referring to someone whose gender is unknown to me and that has helped a little. Unfortunately, I have 13 years of mis-programming to overcome.  It hurts Eldest when I misgender them - I see the pain in their eyes - and I need to make this change in my lexicon quickly.

I was wondering if anyone has advice on how to get used to using they/them pronouns that could help me make Eldest’s journey feel more supportive at home."

counting_on_hearts,I feel like I missed my chance to properly explore having they/them pronouns used for me because of the pandemic,"I'm a lot newer to identifying as nonbinary. I technically have been questioning it for 3 or so years but in the past year started exploring my identity more and came out to a few close friends at school used they/them pronouns around them and lgbt spaces and it felt really nice. But now with quarantine, the only person I talk to that knows is my boyfriend, and he's amazingly supportive, but I never hear my pronouns because why would I. In general, I have no idea how out I want to be, but I don't think ill ever be completely out and tell my parents cause they honestly wouldn't understand and it doesn't feel worth it. But it does sucks to constantly be misgendered.

The problem is, its my very last semester of college and I start working a full time job a month after school's over. College just felt like such a safe place kinda removed from the real world where I could safely explore my identity and now I'm about to enter the real world so I feel like I missed my chance. And in general I don't have many friends so its not like I have many people I can comfortably be out to and explore how out I want be. The company I'm gonna be working for is a pretty big so I wouldn't feel comfortable coming out when I'm still not even used to being out as nonbinary.

D0ng0s,"""They/Them"" Has Gone Too Far (Story + Opinion)","Here's the scoop:

I work in child care. The building has two floors; the first floor is where the AA meetings take place, and the second floor is where I watch the kids for a couple hours until the meetings are over. We've had a baby coming pretty consistently now every Monday. The baby can walk and say some words and numbers, but isn't quite a year old; so still kind of dumb. Here's the catch: on the baby's release form (allergies and toilet training information) has the baby's gender marked as ""they/them"".

I didn't realize this to be the case until a few weeks of having ""them"". They showed up pretty consistently with male looking baby clothes, pictures of dinosaurs, animals, and trains/cars. Then, they showed up the next week with a dress on and their hair in a bun. I was concerned. This is when I double checked the release form and found the gender information. 

Personally, I find this horrible. I can't imagine what confusion this poor kid will grow up with, knowing that they don't have a secure gender to rely a lot of their knowledge on. I'm male, but I'm not very ""manly"" as in I don't know anything about cars or muscles, but I still have things I enjoy doing, and I like the fact that I'm male. And now, parents are starting to transfer these ideologies on their poor kids who don't even have a choice in the matter.

This has now led me to believe that people who don't identify with a gender are beginning to take things too radically. Now this isn't to say all of them are, but this poor baby is an example of that. 

How do you feel about this baby not having a gender? Let me know what you think. I'm opposed to it, but I welcome any ideas on why this might be a good thing to do."

What_exe_has_crashed,Is non-binary specifically only they/them or can it be a bit of a spectrum?,"I’m a bit confused on the exact premise of non-binary and would like to educate myself further on it as to get a better understanding of it. Can people who identify as non-binary feel like they’re a bit more on a spectrum ( example: they feel in between genders, but can lead towards one way of representation sometimes) rather than just they/them and being completely in the middle of male and female?  
     I’ve never felt like I was 100% female, nor did I feel like I was 100% off the chart completely because of my body anatomy. But whenever being referred to as she/her, it just made me feel wrong?? I feel more comfortable with they/them, but still sometimes feel like 25% leaning towards the female side, but still kind of gender ambiguous. Is that non-binary? Or is there another term that I am unaware of that explains this a bit, I’d be really happy to be introduced to it as having a specific word to tie it down makes me feel a bit more comfortable.

I know they/them pronouns are great for many people, but why can’t they use my actual pronouns? It’s better than she/her, but I don’t even get that anymore, mostly just being misinterpreted as nb or somethin. Does anybody else experience this?

Joikebolle666,"They/them pronouns do not contribute to a less divided society, nor does it weaken any gender norms.","Let me start by saying that I do not have anything against people who define themselves as they/them, and I'm not one of those dicks who refuse to call peole by their preferred pronouns. All I'm saying is that when you distance yourself from he/she pronouns, you are giving those pronouns the role and the power you so desperately want them to not have. If we don't want a society divided by gender norms, we shouldn't be making up new genders, we should simply start to break down genders to what they actually are. Genders are just what you got in your pants, your voice, and a few tweaks here and there. It's practical to call people by their genders, because that's what we've always been doing.

If you feel like you're neither a boy or a girl, maybe you should just stick to your chosen gender, and stop caring about what looks and interests are asserted to that gender. And If you're feeling like changing your gender then that's great, all I'm saying is that it's practical to choose one of two.

I would also like to mention that I find this to be a somewhat Western luxury problem. I don't imagine a lot of third world people seeking to be called by  their they/them pronouns. But that's just my guess."

She lives in Europe, I’m in the USA, nearly all of our conversations are via FB Messenger. It’s not a whole lot, and we haven’t been able to talk much lately, so I actually forgot until she messaged me yesterday talking about me in the third person and she called me “they” instead of “she” for the first time and it floored me. It took me by surprise that she actually did it and after the shock wore off I just felt so... good. I asked her to do it because I wasn’t sure if I needed neutral pronouns, and because I trust her to not judge me in case I wanted to revert to feminine pronouns. I don’t. I don’t want to come out to the rest of the world about it either but it feels incredible to just know, you know? I haven’t stopped talking about it and I don’t have anyone else to talk about it to, so. That happened."
