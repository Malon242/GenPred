AceDragonDaddy,Seeing if there is anyone else out there like me! AMAB SRS (he/him),"Hello everyone! 

For the longest time I felt entirely alone in my gender struggle. I‚Äôm an AMAB individual who presents masculine (has a beard and trying to get more muscular) who has pretty significant dysphoria about my bits. I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist for a little under a year now and if this virus doesn‚Äôt fuck everything up, I have bottom surgery scheduled for next year!!!!

For the longest time, I didn‚Äôt know of anyone else like me. I always felt strong feelings of imposter syndrome, not being ‚Äúnon-binary enough‚Äù when trying to interact in these spaces. But with the help of my therapist and some people I‚Äôve talked to I have realized that that‚Äôs shit and I‚Äôm fucking valid! üòé

Anyways, TLDR: I just wanted to put myself out there and let people know that you are not alone! Feel free to reach out to me or respond to this post!"

 I'm not really an egg anymore, I cracked a little while ago. However, I'm not really out to anyone IRL, so with the exception of a mental ""Really, Mike?"" to myself when I mess up or drop something, nobody refers to me as my chosen name. So, I just wanted to see how it feels when someone else calls me by my chosen name. Not sure if it 100% fits with the sub, but I still wanted to try it out.

 In case you all need any information for this: Hi, I'm Michael, but you can call me Mike. I have two cats, and I'm a bit of a nerd. I enjoy drawing and gaming (If you need some games, I've been playing a lot of Magia Record and the Persona series lately). I'm also really into allergen-free cooking/baking (not for a diet, I just have crappy eosinophils). 

 While 3rd person is fine (Ex: ""Have you tried Mike's cookies? They're really good!""), I would prefer the 2nd person (Ex: ""Hey, Mike. Who's your favorite character in Magia Record?""). But, don't let me control stop you. I'll be happy with whatever. 

Thank you all! :)"

greysfanhp,My insomniac thoughts on he/him lesbians,"Lately I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts on he/him lesbians here, and I‚Äôve also seen a couple of people defending them rather admirably. Probably because of those defending he/him lesbians, the issue has stuck in my mind and I think I‚Äôve finally tidied my initial thoughts on the subject and why the whole concept sits wrong with me.

I have a friend I went to school with, let‚Äôs call him Max. Max was born and raised in the UK but has always preferred American culture. As such, when the time came to go to university he shipped himself off to the states. Upon arriving he noticed he was the only Briton in the school, so in an effort to assimilate he adopted an American accent. Adopting the accent allowed him to ‚Äúpass‚Äù as American in his community, this meant less questions for him, not constantly sticking out, and feeling like a more legitimate member of his community. 

Now, does passing as American make Max American? No. Does adopting the accent and culture of Americans make him an American? No. Is he allowed to change his accent and assimilate as much as he wants to feel comfortable? Of course.

However, if Max goes to a bar and he‚Äôs asked where he‚Äôs from, if he replies, ‚ÄúNew York‚Äù Max is being unethical because he is lying. Max may have his reasons for telling this lie, but this does not change the fact he is not a New Yorker and therefore the descriptor does not belong to him. It is a lie. Therefore, to say Max is a New Yorker is to make a false statement. 

Similarly, there are lesbian women out there who grew up preferring masculine culture. As soon as possible, they adopted that in their presentation to the point where they ‚Äúpass‚Äù as straight men. Does this make them straight men? No. Are they allowed to present as masculine as they like? Of course. However, if they use male pronouns, they are lying. They may have excellent reasons for lying (safety, ease, etc), but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact they are lying. Therefore, to take a lie and use that as the basis for making the statement that ‚Äúhe/him lesbians exist‚Äù, is invalid. They don‚Äôt exist, those he/him lesbians are still she/her women who just happen to engage in deceit for reasons x, y, z. 

When making ontological claims (aka, claims about what exists), the lies people perpetuate should not supersede the underlying truth. 

But hey ho, those are just the insomniac ramblings of your friendly neighbourhood philosopher."

With the increasing fluidity of both gender identity and expression, my definition of a lesbian is a fem-aligned person (she/they) who is attracted to other fem-aligned people. just to clarify, this Obviously includes butch women and trans women. 



i've seen a couple of different explanations for he/him lesbians. while pronouns dont always equal gender, they do reflect it, so it seems redundant for a woman who's completely comfortable being a woman, no matter how masc she presents, to use male-aligned pronouns. (im not talking about for their own safety) so if you're a he/him lesbian who's completely fine with womanhood, why use he/him pronouns at all? 



then i saw that he/him lesbians Aren't comfortable with/connected to their womanhood. if thats the case, how comes u identify as a woman instead of non-binary? and if you're a woman who isn't comfortable with womanhood or a fem presenting non binary person, why ONLY use he/him pronouns, instead of she, they or any other combination?



if you're non-binary, mainly/only present as masc, and Only use he/him pronouns, why do you choose to identify as a lesbian at all, instead of just saying you're queer or only attracted to women?  
 


if you're non-binary, no matter how you present, why say he/him lesbian, instead of just non-binary lesbian? a term that still relates to you, and from what i've seen is a bit more accepted.   



i know there are loads of questions and some may come across as rude or overly nosy, but im Genuinely trying to understand."

alt_account_why_not,Hi - Can I be *both* he/him and them/they? How do share that without confusing everyone else?,"Hi - 

I am AMAB and look the part like I'm from central casting.

&#x200B;

I was raised with he/him, and I've zero issue with that. I'm also equally comfortable with they/them...

&#x200B;

...increasingly, I prefer to use both: \*\*I'm a ""they"" that doesn't mind being addressed ""he"".\*\*

&#x200B;

Why? I've so much of my identity wrapped up in years (decades...) of ""he/him"" that correcting everyone is...well...that's just not the hill I need to personally die on. For me, I'm okay with both. And I'm actually okay with ""she"" if I'm misgendered...if the person I'm speaking with greets me with a smile and acknowledges \*me\*, I'm good. There are plenty of ways to invalidate someone while still getting their pronouns right...I'm worried about those larger invalidating things rather than my pronouns.

&#x200B;

Still, I'd like to raise more quiet awareness of existing assumptions. Just having a pin announcing *""Hi - I prefer he/him* ***and/or*** *they/them.""* encourages the observer that assumptions about my AMAB should end there. (i.e. There may be correlations -- probably lots of them -- but their not causality related.)

&#x200B;

(If it makes a difference, grammatically within the same written document I try for consistency so I don't confuse readers. But in conversation, I alternate.)  


**My question is this:** 

>How can I publicly navigate announcing my preference, and identification, as both he/him and they/them while minimizing the chance I'll confuse the observer?

When anyone calls me he, it takes me off guard still, but at the same time it takes me off guard when someone misgenders me. My name is easier to get used to, but pronouns are weird. Also, when my boyfriend calls me handsome or anything like that, it throws me off. 

I accidentally said ""most other girls"" the other day because I was talking about female anatomy and my boyfriend was like ""you're not a girl tho"". It was sweet but it made me feel weird cause if I'm actually trans shouldnt it feel more natural to go by male? Idk, I keep coming across these little things that make me question myself. Sometimes I feel like more of a drag king than a trans guy, but I dont know if that's just internalized transphobia."

I've had few ideas - Donovan, Rodion, Ranulf and Destin. And, possibly, Tobias.

I'm Russian so all but one of them are unusual for my country ^(and two of them are norse names because i like norse names. i also really live wolves), but I don't mind. I tried choosing those that aren't too hard to pronounce with my accent haha. 

I tried using two of those but I'm really interested in trying out new names and what makes me feel how. I chose some Norse names due to them making me feel like some kind of honorable warrior, which is the theme I really like and would totally love going for with my name.

They were born female and they embrace and express almost exclusively female style. Eyeliner, makeup, long hair/wig, nails done, cute clothes, etc. A lot of the time these women will be in a relationship with a straight male lol!

I called a girl out. She was a young, petite, blonde stripper. I said ""Why do you want to be called he/him?""

""Because I identify as NB""

""Okay but why masc pronouns?""

""I feel like I'm a boy""

""Why do you do your make up, wear long hair, and look female as fuck then?""

""I don't have to be passing to be valid!""

I have come to the conclusion that most people are just making things up to appear cool, trendy, etc. They also want to be oppressed so they can play victim or get online and soap box about things they don't even stand for !"

Feel free to comment and educate if I‚Äôm incorrect.

infinite-philautia,Isolation (he/him) [family/friends] [rant],"TW: homophobia/transphobia, mentions of COVID-19

With everything that is happening in the world right now, it doesn‚Äôt really have to be said that my family is currently in self-isolation. My mom and I get along fine usually. She‚Äôs aware that I am trans, and she typically just avoids using gendered terms at all (she did this before I came out as well so I‚Äôm okay with it). My dad, however, is a different story. I‚Äôve told him 5+ times over the past 3 years. He says he‚Äôs okay with it, but he thinks it‚Äôs unnatural. He keeps calling me ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù and ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù. There are other problems with him as well, but those aren‚Äôt lgbt related. My school has been closed for a week now, and it‚Äôs going to be close for AT LEAST another month. We also just had spring break last week tho (so I‚Äôve been out for 2 weeks). My dad was off of work last week and he went back this week, however he‚Äôs work closed yesterday for AT LEAST two weeks. I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this.

Even worse, I went to my grandmother‚Äôs yesterday. She lives right around the street and neither of us have left the house and she lives alone so my parents thought it would be a great idea for me to get out some a visit her. Well when I went, she started talking about how being gay/lesbian is a ‚Äúhorrible sin‚Äù. She asked me if I knew anyone at my school that is ‚Äúthat way‚Äù. I told her I didn‚Äôt know (which is a complete lie, I‚Äôm literally an officer for my GSA). She doesn‚Äôt know about me, or at least I don‚Äôt think. She might suspect something, but now I know I really can‚Äôt come out to her.

I don‚Äôt want to have to deal with this anymore. I almost wish I would get sick just so I could be away from them."
