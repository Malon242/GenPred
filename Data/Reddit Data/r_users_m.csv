AceDragonDaddy,Seeing if there is anyone else out there like me! AMAB SRS (he/him),"Hello everyone! 

For the longest time I felt entirely alone in my gender struggle. I‚Äôm an AMAB individual who presents masculine (has a beard and trying to get more muscular) who has pretty significant dysphoria about my bits. I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist for a little under a year now and if this virus doesn‚Äôt fuck everything up, I have bottom surgery scheduled for next year!!!!

For the longest time, I didn‚Äôt know of anyone else like me. I always felt strong feelings of imposter syndrome, not being ‚Äúnon-binary enough‚Äù when trying to interact in these spaces. But with the help of my therapist and some people I‚Äôve talked to I have realized that that‚Äôs shit and I‚Äôm fucking valid! üòé

Anyways, TLDR: I just wanted to put myself out there and let people know that you are not alone! Feel free to reach out to me or respond to this post!"

WiccaWhale,"everyone calls me jamie, but nobody calls me he/him and it really hurts",
FieFireFive,"Michael (Mike), He/Him","Hey, everyone! 

 I'm not really an egg anymore, I cracked a little while ago. However, I'm not really out to anyone IRL, so with the exception of a mental ""Really, Mike?"" to myself when I mess up or drop something, nobody refers to me as my chosen name. So, I just wanted to see how it feels when someone else calls me by my chosen name. Not sure if it 100% fits with the sub, but I still wanted to try it out.

 In case you all need any information for this: Hi, I'm Michael, but you can call me Mike. I have two cats, and I'm a bit of a nerd. I enjoy drawing and gaming (If you need some games, I've been playing a lot of Magia Record and the Persona series lately). I'm also really into allergen-free cooking/baking (not for a diet, I just have crappy eosinophils). 

 While 3rd person is fine (Ex: ""Have you tried Mike's cookies? They're really good!""), I would prefer the 2nd person (Ex: ""Hey, Mike. Who's your favorite character in Magia Record?""). But, don't let me control stop you. I'll be happy with whatever. 

Thank you all! :)"

We have a history, so part of me is wondering if this is her way of ""complying"" without ""complying"".  Or if she's genuinely getting used to it still."

I've had few ideas - Donovan, Rodion, Ranulf and Destin. And, possibly, Tobias.

I'm Russian so all but one of them are unusual for my country ^(and two of them are norse names because i like norse names. i also really live wolves), but I don't mind. I tried choosing those that aren't too hard to pronounce with my accent haha. 

I tried using two of those but I'm really interested in trying out new names and what makes me feel how. I chose some Norse names due to them making me feel like some kind of honorable warrior, which is the theme I really like and would totally love going for with my name. 

Whaddaya'll think? I accept some new suggestions too!

infinite-philautia,Isolation (he/him) [family/friends] [rant],"TW: homophobia/transphobia, mentions of COVID-19

With everything that is happening in the world right now, it doesn‚Äôt really have to be said that my family is currently in self-isolation. My mom and I get along fine usually. She‚Äôs aware that I am trans, and she typically just avoids using gendered terms at all (she did this before I came out as well so I‚Äôm okay with it). My dad, however, is a different story. I‚Äôve told him 5+ times over the past 3 years. He says he‚Äôs okay with it, but he thinks it‚Äôs unnatural. He keeps calling me ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù and ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù. There are other problems with him as well, but those aren‚Äôt lgbt related. My school has been closed for a week now, and it‚Äôs going to be close for AT LEAST another month. We also just had spring break last week tho (so I‚Äôve been out for 2 weeks). My dad was off of work last week and he went back this week, however he‚Äôs work closed yesterday for AT LEAST two weeks. I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this.

Even worse, I went to my grandmother‚Äôs yesterday. She lives right around the street and neither of us have left the house and she lives alone so my parents thought it would be a great idea for me to get out some a visit her. Well when I went, she started talking about how being gay/lesbian is a ‚Äúhorrible sin‚Äù. She asked me if I knew anyone at my school that is ‚Äúthat way‚Äù. I told her I didn‚Äôt know (which is a complete lie, I‚Äôm literally an officer for my GSA). She doesn‚Äôt know about me, or at least I don‚Äôt think. She might suspect something, but now I know I really can‚Äôt come out to her.

I don‚Äôt want to have to deal with this anymore. I almost wish I would get sick just so I could be away from them."

nogyyy,i am a man of culture as you can clearly see,
fluffito5,I AM A MAN,
ranc1dpsych0,I am a man who is dating a woman who is transgender AMA,"Ill give you guys some basics:

This is an AMA. So you can ask whatever you like. The reason why I made this post to begin with is because Im willing to put myself out there for any question, no matter how personal. Im ready to accept praise or face criticism from people here.

I am 31 and I identify as straight. All my past relationships have been cis women. And I dont find myself attractive to cis men or trans men

I would argue that being with my new girlfriend is a lot like being with any other girl I've been with in terms of how we react to one another and just the general dynamic of the relationship.

She is what people call ""pre-op"" as in, yes, she still has a penis. She wishes to undergo sexual reassignment surgery. I support her decision. As of right now though she does take hormones. Shes been on HRT since she was 18 (shes 28 now).

Nobody knows my girlfriend is trans. My parents dont know Im dating yet. My friends have met her however but do not know she is trans (at least they havent told me yet). I have admitted to my friends that I am ok with dating a trans women in the past before I met my girlfriend however

Were still early in our relationship. Its only been a couple of months. But Ill admit Im falling very hard for her.  


EDIT: I also made this post for other men who are like me. Maybe you've found trans women attractive but youve been too ashamed to admit it for fear of being bullied and ridiculed. Im writing this to tell you that you are not alone, and you dont have to be afraid to express your feelings as a man. Its okay. I understand you like women. Stop being so concerned on what everything thinks and embrace yourself for once. "

I went from fantasizing about being a young boy having sex with a mature woman to being the mature woman having sex with a young boy (ages 13 to 16, incase anyone is wondering). What draws me towards it is being a beautiful woman and having power the young teen and seducing him, making him my sex slave. What got me into this fantasy was when I saw a hentai called ""Juvenile Pornagraphy"", where a young teen meets a woman at a park and she lures him into her apartment and has her way with him. I should feel disgusted with myself, but I'm not. It was weird at first, but I have embraced it. Not something I'd proudly share to anyone in public. I just wanted to finally get it off my chest by admitting it anonymously.

Just in case anyone is wondering, I have no urges to hurt any actual children. I know how to separate fantasy from reality. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I hurt a child; knowing how much it could traumatize someone."

Things started moving very fast and we started dating. She is a mother of 2 and is in the middle of a nasty divorce, so age wasn't really something we talked about because I assumed she was older. She is OK with the age difference, but I am slightly offput by it.

Her soon-to-be ex-husband started seeing her when she was 15 and he was 20. I often make a comment that I think he was a child predator and that was totally unacceptable. But our age gap is even larger. Am I a hypocrite? Obviously I would have -never- dated her if she was 15 and I was 21. The thought that would have been the situation though bothers me. 

Anyways, to wrap up, am I doing something morally wrong? I really love this woman. After I ended a 10 year relationship and then met her, I honestly feel like I may be in love for the first time. I don't want to be doing something wrong."
WestCost2,(soon to be) Mother in law doesn't like the fact that I am a man,"Me : M (32) , Him : M(34)

I think the problem his parents , particularly his mother, have against me is that I'm a man.

He's bisexual, he used to date both men and women. I think she's trying really hard to break us up so that he can date and marry a woman.

We live in a small apartment near the city center - the kitchen is so small that you can't really do any cooking other than heating up food. We used to eat takeouts for both lunch and dinner. Usually we have our lunch separately at our own offices and we have dinner together at home.

Due to this whole situation I am working from home, he has been furloughed. We cannot go out to buy lunch / dinner every day and we cannot afford to order delivery , so we have to cook simple stuff - ramen with some frozen meatballs, heating up frozen pizza etc

His mother is not happy about this. She checks in with him every day and asks him what he eats. She even called me personally and requested that I cook fresh food for him, which is not possible since I am working two jobs. She wanted to send us food she cooked from home. I refused for her own safety. I told her that it's too dangerous for her to drive >20 miles just to send us food. I told her in advance that if she takes food over we will not open the door and even if she leaves the food by the door, we will throw it away - we just don't want her to send us food. Then she suggested that we move over to theirs - not possible since it's a rural place with poor internet.

She called me and yelled at me for ""abusing"" her 30+ years old fully-abled son

What is he doing ? He's asking me to understand her better, think from her perspective, try to reach an amicable solution - all those BS. He's completely spineless and just won't take a side.

I think she's just taking this opportunity to scare me off

What do you think and how should I approach this ?

&#x200B;

TL;DR : soon-to-be mother-in-law tries her hardest to break us up so that her son would marry a girl instead."

Ownard,"Just because I am a man, doesn't mean I can do all your moving and handling by myself.","I am a student nurse in my second year and I have to say, while I have had other placements that have been physically exhausting, my current one had to be the most emotionally exhausting one. 

I am in a geriatrics receiving unit, so while the docs finish the assessment from the ED, we nursing staff take care of them until they get moved to a ward. 

But some of these old people, particularly the women can just ruin my day if they keep up their antics. I've just been on for 3 days, on the same 6 beds and I guarantee at least half of the old women I have had have been on either extreme of horrible or an angel.

One today really made me have to say to my mentor that I need a wee 5 minutes to calm down a bit and say that I wasn't going in there at all.

This old lady insisted that because I am a man, I can just pick her up and put her on a comode, despite her being able to walk with assistance of one person. Then another time when the two girls were changing her bedding, I was asked to grab a sheet and she went off on one that I should be doing all the work and the girls should be sitting having a cup of tea.

Normally I can take this on the chin but what made it worse was the abuse and the swearing I got back for saying that I couldn't do those for her. Firstly, because I already have back problems and secondly she's able to walk herself alebiet with someone holding her arm. I just felt really degraded by what she was saying.

I just feel like there are too many people who think because I am a man, I'm going to do all the heavy lifting. I simply cannot and there is no way to get it through to these ones and even when the senior nurses explain it to them, it just seems to make them more horrible towards me. 

I know is shouldn't let this get to me as much as I am, but today was just too far gone and just upset me. Thankfully, my mentor is very kind and let me go home half an hour early because I think she could tell this lady had pushed my temper on an already freyed end (been chronically understaffed and just a crappy set of shifts back to back with both bad staff and patients). 

I just don't think geriatrics is going to be an area for me when it comes to choosing where I work once I finish my course. Which I find a shame because I have always preferred working with older people in my other placements - although I've had more bad patients in this placement than all my.other placements combined."

I am 31 and I identify as straight. All my past relationships have been cis women. And I dont find myself attractive to cis men or trans men

I would argue that being with my new girlfriend is a lot like being with any other girl I've been with in terms of how we react to one another and just the general dynamic of the relationship.

She is what people call ""pre-op"" as in, yes, she still has a penis. She wishes to undergo sexual reassignment surgery. I support her decision. As of right now though she does take hormones. Shes been on HRT since she was 18 (shes 28 now).

Nobody knows my girlfriend is trans. My parents dont know Im dating yet. My friends have met her however but do not know she is trans (at least they havent told me yet). I have admitted to my friends that I am ok with dating a trans women in the past before I met my girlfriend however

Well, I'm hispanic and she comes from a small town. When she started working I never pay attention to her because I thought she was 16-17 (Still not illegal, but I would think that's very inappropriate) but she is 18, and I got to know her better and I like her physically and her personality. Honestly, I really, really like her. Honestly, she's so beautiful that I won't try to kiss her on our first dates, she deserves more than that.

So long story short, I basically started talking to her, she would make goofy jokes to made me laugh, and after a few days, I decided to sit on the same table with her on the breakroom. I was talking to her, but all of sudden, an ASM came, and a lot of people came, and I got really scared that they would make any assumptions like I was flirting her and I just stand and got out from there without saying goodbye or without ending the conversation. Then, I started ignoring her, and next time I saw her in the breakroom I ignored her completely, but when I turned my head that day in the breakroom after a while, there she was staring at me with a smile like ""Are you serious?"" Or like ""What's going on?""

Once again, I really like her, but I don't want to get in trouble because I would ask her out. I just don't want to have the wrong idea and that she goes to management and tell them I'm flirting with her. I love Walmart, I love my job, I won't put anything at risk for it. I was thinking on drawing a heart on a piece of paper and put it on the lock of her locker. Do you think that's crazy? Do you think she could report that and take a look at the cameras? I just don't know guys. Did anyone face that same situation before? I would appreciate all your help

Let me know and well, if you guys find this as something just crazy, I won't try to talk to her and ask her out then."

It seems though that girls have this fantasy, and not so much men. Am I weird? 

I feel so off/disconnected because the narrative seems that rape fantasies should always be with men in the power, or men taking the charge in the bedroom, or always men leading the sexual interaction. 

It's just getting exhausting.. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy a dominate fantasy here or there, but I'd just appreciate it if some women decided to put in some more effort too rather than expecting me to ""do this do that lead the bedroom lead this lead that."" Can I just have a break for 5 minutes of submission?

holditbacknow,I am a man. I control my thoughts and needs and you can too!,"Hi all. First post. Glad I am doing this instead of going to porn. I recently started my NoFap journey in February. It's been 45+ days and I have felt the amazing benefits.

I was the average porn watcher. I would lurk on 4chan and RedTube to get my fix.

I have always wanted to stop looking at porn or at least be able to control myself. I used to do it when I was bored or to release some steam.

When I did I used to get angry or annoyed because I told myself many times after that the result is me feeling grouchy and unfocused. Not a good way to release steam or even maintain focus in life!

I had a weird introduction into the world of porn. I had experienced my first orgasm accidentally on a vibrating exercise belt (aka fat jiggler google it - lol how embarrassing). I never knew what the heck it meant when it happened. All I knew was that it felt amazing!

I had to understand WHY it felt amazing. During that time I met a friend at a young age who understood and watched porn. He introduced me into porn. I wish I never did, nor was it their fault. Natural part of life to find it I guess, or should I say by today's digital standards its 'normal'.

This developed in me a curiosity. I wanted to know more about the beauty of a woman. The personality, body, love. What makes it so?

Is it wrong to have this curiosity? I would say no. If you do as well you shouldn't shy it away, instead accept it and learn how to deal with it. When you hide it in yourself I think you introduce insecurities. Anyways...

So I started looking at porn from a young age. Looking at hundreds of naked beautiful woman and PMOing. But slowly I started looking at videos, and more videos. Down the rabbit hole I went.

There was no self control. Sometimes being too curious is not good, but as a young boy who am I to tell, share or ask what the heck I am looking at or what to feel?

Now 23, I decided to make a change. I share this today because not many say HOW they got started into the rabbit hole of porn. I have and I hope some of you have similar stories or are willing to share below.

I must be strong with my decision to NoFap. I have partially relapsed once BUT NO MORE! I said to myself I can do 100 days more since I was ABOUT to relapse. I was up to 45 days. No, I won't let me weakness go that easily AND I hope you don't either! I think I have passed the 90 day mark but I will keep going. I know I can!

What helped for me also was when I noticed the urge I would stop, breath and say to myself, 'I accept this urge, but I won't let it control me.' I didn't ignore it. I faced it. Then it subsided and I felt courage and strength after. I would wake up the next day and say 'I DID THAT!'. You can do this too!

Allow me to instill the confidence in you to KEEP GOING!

YOU CAN DO IT. WHEN YOU FEEL YOURSELF TYPE THAT DESPISED WEB LINK INTO YOUR PHONE OR BROWSER BAR, TYPE IN NOFAP EMERGENCY BECAUSE DEEP DOWN INSIDE YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO WATCH THE PORN FOR THE REASONS YOU ARE OPENING IT FOR.

BECAUSE ONLY YOU KNOW THE TYPE OF MAN YOU WANT TO BECOME! YOU WANT TO BE THE ULTIMATE VERSION OF WHAT YOU CAN BE (AND I DO TOO!)

Give it a try! We can do this together!

Thank you NoFap and the community for your posts. I hope my post instills the same feeling of courage and strength as others have done for me.

For some reason, despite all of this, I have enormous testosterone levels. This has resulted in me having the body of statues depicting the Greek God of War. 

However, each time someone gets wet and I take them back to mine, I can‚Äôt get there. They look at my lack of lower cleavage, and shame me. 

‚ÄúBAD NO BALL BOY‚Äù, they say, ‚ÄúNO FINISH FOR YOU.‚Äù 

And so I shall die, alone and loveless"

xPawreen,[routine help] how do i moisturize face correctly? (i am a man so idk how),"Am I moisturizing my face correctly? If only there was a post to dumb it down and explain it to me.... (RIP advent calendar posts, so helpful for us newbies because the sidebar doesn't have any good information)

I am a man and every post I see on here is way to complex for me to be bothered doing. 

I want to put 1 thing on my face once a day because anything more is too complicated for me. 

Right now I am putting body lotion on my face every morning but it makes my face feels oily. Can someone give me advice on a SIMPLE thing I can do? I am a man so keep it SIMPLE."

weezerwookie,"My name is Alma, and I am a Man","This name has been a pain for me on a nearly daily basis for just about as long as I can remember. At school, teachers would tell me ""But Alma is a girls name,"" as if I chose it for myself.

I resented it for much of my life. I've thought about changing it legally several times. I could go by my middle name Hunter. I've tried, but it doesn't fit me. I've never gone hunting lol, and it's not what I was called growing up. The truth is that I like being called Alma by my friends and family. It's my name.

Around 18 I realized that i would have much less hassle if I just introduced myself as ""Al,"" which is easy for me to respond to, easy to remember. I'm OK with my name, but in the vast majority of cultures, Alma is a girls name. It's basically been used only as a boys name in old Hebrew, but these days the only men or boys you will find with the name Alma are from Latter-Day Saint (Mormon) families.

I stopped practicing Mormonism when I was 18. But, both of my parents were raised Mormon, and raised me in that church as well. They are from southeast Idaho and Utah. The LDS and most organized religions as a whole don't really fit me, however I still consider myself a Mormon culturally and genetically.

\[Side Note - I took an Ancestry DNA test and it identifies my genome with the Mormon Pioneers of the Mountain West genetic group. When I tell people this, many of them disagree and say that the science is bogus. Perhaps they don't think Mormons deserve to be considered an ethnicity. It's legit, backed by academics. Basically Ancestry DNA (which happens to be Utah based) most likely forms core groups of people who are really into genealogy and are confident that their genetic parents and grandparents are those in the records. They use those records to figure out places of birth, death, marriages, to figure out migration patterns and voila. Most of the Mormon pioneers immigrated from Britain and Denmark in the mid-late 1800s.\]

Any who, I still like my name, but think it would be cruel to give it to a boy. I gave it to my daughter.

We left my dad when I was 6. My mom told me it was my dad's idea. I graduated high school, went into the military and started to write my dad, who was then is still incarcerated, why he gave me that name. He said he was reading the book of Mormon, and really liked the characters named Alma, so he gave that to me.

He also said I should listen to Johnny Cash's ""Boy Named Sue"" song. And this lyric basically is the sentiment he gave me: ""Son, this world is rough, And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough, And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along. So I give ya that name and I said goodbye, I knew you'd have to get tough or die. And it's the name that helped to make you strong""

I don't think I'm stronger than average in a general or physical sense. I barely made it thru Army basic training. I became a news writer and photographer in the Army, deployed to Iraq but never killed anyone, never fired a shot in anger either. Went to a hippy state college. The man who raised me is a Mexican immigrant. I went to Mexico after college to teach English, where Alma is even more a female thing. Lived there for a couple years, met my wife, and now I work in public affairs, which is a more feminine dominated field, but whatever.

Dopenastywhale,"I am a man and I grew up watching Mia Hamm and played soccer (football) because of her. Looking back, what female inspirations have you had in your life?","Edit:  Just wanted to say thanks to the people contributing.  I have read all the comments so far, even the weird ones.  Some takeaways: Yall have good moms, there are tons of tough ass grammas, and there are a lot of public figures I had never even heard of which is on me, but still something to consider.

Advice I have, for what its worth, tell the people in your life that have impacted you how much they mean to you.  You may not have a chance to later and it is something they will appreciate."
