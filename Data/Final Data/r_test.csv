Any time I get this as a daily, I die EVERY time OR I get hit with franklin\'s while running out the exit...\n\n<ITALIC> A habit I have picked up is whenever I open a chest, I take the item to an exit gate and make a pile.  If someone with an item is sacrificed, I shuttle the item over to the gate and add it to MY PILE.  I have had, at maximum, a 6 item pile before.  My theory behind this is simply, if anyone needs anything it is all in the same place and god forbid someone else has my cursed daily, all the stuff is right there on your way out.  Also, if I have my cursed daily, I know where everything is so I can grab it on my way out.\n\n<ITALIC> But over the last few weeks, something amazing happened.\n\n<BOLD> First, there was a leatherface.  One sacrifice, one DC, five gens to go, ruin active...  I had already put two items in my pile and this leatherface took pity on my Nea and a random David and started farming.  I did gens and kept adding to the pile and when it came time to leave, leatherface saw my pile and took a screenshot.  Messaged me after and asked why.  I told him it was for anybody that needed it, and in the case of farming - I was giving David the pick of the loot.  Dude said that was super cool of me and we went on our merry way.\n\n<ITALIC> So...  We all know Legion needs some work.  However, I still have not won a round against him/her.

Gens are done, gates are not open yet.  Remember Me is a thing.  I\'m being chased.  I decide to just run to my pile, blood puddles keeping him on my tail.  I crouch by the loot stash and he downs me.\n\nHe looks at me...  Takes a long look at my pile...  Spams the pick up and drop until I\'m on my feet...  Nods, hits the gate lever, I open it, and I leave.  Tried to message him but his messages are turned off.\n\n<BOLD> 3 hours later I encounter another Legion -  I\'m doing gens, unhooking, making my pile.  Comes down to just me.  Gens done, gates closed, Legion hovering between the gates and watching the hatch.  I go to the gate with my pile and pull the lever.\n\nLegion arrives, hits me once, I grab the lever again, he downs me...  Again, he takes a long look at my pile...  Pick-up/drop spam...

Legion leaves me and I\'m just gathering crows, trusting in the pile. \n\nShe sacrifices Laurie...  Comes back to me.  Picks me up and I don\'t wiggle.

I don‚Äôt know what your set up is like and I know you mentioned a few of these things already, but I‚Äôll try and hit the basics! This reddit is an amazing resource for fish info and you should 100% take advantage of it to the fullest, whether it be general info, questions, anything!\r\n\r\n[General tank stuff:]\r\nBettas need at least a 2.5 gallon tank, and would recommend 5 gallons or more if possible. You‚Äôll need a heater and thermometer for your tank, they do best around 78-80 degrees F (just be careful and do research about the heater you get! low quality ones have been known to cook fish). A filter too of course, whatever the right one for your size tank is. Depending on your filter, you may have to find a way to baffle it, as bettas don‚Äôt like too strong of a water flow. There are lots of ways to do it! People often use sponges or cut up a piece of water bottle, look around and you‚Äôll find some different methods. \r\n\r\n[Decor:]\r\nLots of hiding places! The more filled your tank is, the happier your boy will be. Just make sure there are no sharp edges or holes he could get stuck in on your decor. Lots of people will use live plants, but fake silk ones are easy to start with! Make sure they‚Äôre silk and not hard plastic, because hard plastic can rip through his fins. \r\n\r\n[Upkeep/Water stuff:]\r\nThere are good guides for tank cycling on this reddit, make sure to check them out! Read over the article for fish-in cycling carefully, it‚Äôll be really important for his health. You‚Äôll want to get a good test kit for your water, preferably the liquid kind (it‚Äôs the most accurate). I use purified water for my tank because I‚Äôm in a dorm and there‚Äôs a refiller just outside my room, but tap water is fine as long as you add water conditioner to it to make it fish safe, which you‚Äôll also need to get. I use API stresscoat, but a lot of people swear by Seachem Prime. I‚Äôd also get a gravel vacuum/siphon, a good tank scrubber, and a nice big bucket for water changes. It‚Äôs good to do partial water changes on your tank about once a week, it keeps your water and tank clean!\r\n\r\n[Feeding:]\r\nYou‚Äôll probably want your staple food to be pellets. They‚Äôre an easy and nutritious way to feed them. I believe there‚Äôs a page on this reddit listing a few high quality brands, but personally I use Omega One brand.

While the song is yet another character study, this character is actually Damon himself; Dan Abnormal is an anagram of Damon Albarn. The song entails that while Damon engages in many of the same activities as regular people, such as drinking and watching TV, his position as a entertainer means he‚Äôs not ‚Äúnormal at all‚Äù in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nMusically I‚Äôd say this is one of the most ‚ÄòBritpop-y‚Äô songs they ever made.

While it is not his kind of country, he ultimately has to stop trying to ‚Äòmake her mine‚Äô, and come to the conclusion that as a whole, America isn‚Äôt all that bad.\r\n\r\nMusically the song bears a very strong resemblance to End Of The Century, to the degree that it almost seems like a musical sequel to that song.

I now see it is possible to take advantage of this tax credit for next year's tax season. I'm just gonna lower my 401k and flexible spending account contributions, and claim tax exempt to give myself a bigger pay check. I guess I can put that money to a Roth instead. I also expect a promotion very soon. With those three factors, it would give me a tax liability that this credit should wipe out when tax season comes around.\r\n\r\nOP: I feel like I may have been victimized by predatory sales and lending practices.

I was sold on what I  thought would be a $7-$8,000 refund I would get in addition to the  $5-6,000 I normally get each year from the IRS.\r\n\r\nI bought the panels with a loan. The loan has an introductory period, where you  only pay on like $16,000 of the loan, and if you don't give them the $8k  within 18 months the loan goes up to the full amount, and the minimum payment goes up as well. That will make it so that my loan payments on the panels cost more than my electricity did before solar, so that makes going green a luxury for those who make much more money than I do.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm trying to figure out how to get that money. I've been thinking that maybe there's a way I could do my refund this year that would give me that additional rebate, but that would give me a tax liability next year that would be covered by the solar panel tax credit.

I believe this is due to me being bisexual and a little slutty haha. I have heard that T-cream/gel can keep this from happening but I want to know more.

If anybody else sees this, respectful people like myself usually wont teabag unless you\'re a face-camper. Next in line are the people who start out respectful, get burned by campers and butthurt over survivors not being able to save them a bunch, and then become salty players that teabag all the time. Third are all the little idiots from COD that just think being a jerk/rude piece of shit is funny.\n\nSo yeah, there are some bad survivors, but this post is coming from someone who usually tries to play a fair and respectful game, gives positive props regularly, sends GG messages even when I get killed...

Key points - I never play SWF (that\'s practically cheating).  My SO is a Killer Main (and I have played killer but I\'m rubbish), I watch him play like a boss while being fair and I also get aggravated at bad mannered survivors and if one in particular is being extra disckish, I actually encourage my SO to face-camp JUST that guy.  I respect all of your opinions unless you\'re intentionally being a rude little shit like it\'s actually going to hurt me (I\'ve got a 9 year old, that childish nonsense doesn\'t phase me and hasn\'t phased me for about 6 years).  Lastly, this post isn\'t meant to be a ""follow these rules"" post, or a ""You better play like this"" post, or a ""I hate these kinds of killers"" post...  Seriously, I don\'t care how you play, I haven\'t disconnected once and don\'t plan to (even with crazy lag).

I\'m more than open to hearing what nerves were struck here.  Replies are more than welcome.\n\nThe definition of respectful has changed here in 2020.\n\nHonestly, there\'s no way to deal with concerns like this currently.  You have a huge majority against things such as this for either religious or generally conservative reasons.  Then you have a MUCH louder minority that says everyone should have the right to identify as a street lamp.\n\nIf we were to require counseling before a major transgender decision - It would be deemed insensitive and discriminatory.\n\nIf we were to ignore this entirely - You have a million confused children swapping genders like a pole vaulter and suffering mentally from the confusion.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that some people truly do feel like they are the wrong gender and more power to them in correcting their body to match their mind.\n\nBut as far as the wave of pressuring kids one way or the other as their parent or moreso riding this ""I\'m a unicorn"" fad-like wave of thought...  It needs to stop.\n\nExample:  I am bisexual (but male leaning).  My daughter has only ever seen me be in relationships with men like her father or the guys that followed after we split but she knows that I have been intimate with women.\n\nFor the LONGEST time I kind of got the feeling that she might be into girls.  However, I didn\'t acknowledge it out loud for a long time.  Two years ago when she was ten, she came to me and asked how someone might know they are gay.  \n\nWe had a chat and I told her the following, ""You\'re ten.  The next ten years of your life are crucial in figuring out who you are.  You can feel whatever way you want and you can claim an orientation whenever you want...  But maybe don\'t.  Don\'t pick a label just yet.  Be you, explore who you are, and when you\'re about to graduate high school really assess how you feel.  The problem these days is it\'s REALLY COOL to have a label that\'s not considered the norm because it makes kids feel unique.  The thing is, you\'ll be more unique if you let people know that you\'re still feeling things out.""\n\nShe\'s nearly 13 now.  She has come out as Bi and we are totally fine with that.  I took great care in not influencing this outcome.\n\nI\'ve been flabbergasted by this huge wave of <BOLD> YOU MUST IDENTIFY AS SOMETHING with younger kids because these years are already hard enough with figuring out who you are and where you fit in without adding ten thousand more letters to what used to LGBT.  \n\nNow we have LGBTQSHSRSDFVNKAENRIHNERITU$HW%T^<ITALIC> O<HEADING> H$TQ#OBTV$OHN VTOQ#$TBQN#I$OHTN#Q( or whatever the hell and that really can\'t make life easy on a young mind.\n\nIt was hard enough finding the right people to sit with at lunch...  But that\'s part of growing up.\n\nParents stepping into this and adding pressure one way or the other doesn\'t help and it hinders the child\'s independence.  It hinders their understanding of the self.\n\n<BOLD> <SUMMARY>  There\'s no respectful way to deal with this.  Just try to lead by example.  Let your kid find their own identity.  They\'ll more than likely become a balanced adult of whatever flavor they choose and you can be proud of that.']",F

MuchAdoAboutFutaloo,"[""Thanks for the good feedback, I'll keep these changes in mind. I have a multiclass fix planned now which is effectively: <BOLD> this class is incompatible with other casters by nature to prevent that as an issue.\n\nI felt the spellcasting stat might be an issue but I'll have to decide between the value of its theming or making it INT and changing some of the class flavor. I think my current opinion is accepting the natural strength of its spell stat being limited by how seldom it will opt to use spells over arcane rush. You're probably right, but I tend to prefer good flavor making something's balance iffy over neutering the personality of it for balance reasons, at least in DnD.\n\nI personally like mechanics that are unprecedented sometimes, and the unique nature of the heals is what drew me to using it on this class. Keep in mind the heal is 1d4 x arcane rush mod per hit, so at absolute worst you're gonna heal 20hp with your 5th level spell slot in a turn; I don't expect people to miss much with a magic weapon and a +5 to hit. Because of the unique nature of the healing I want its potency to be a little bit situational, and I think it's just my personal preference to have it function this way. Nothing you said about it is wrong, I just enjoy the quirks in it. c:\n\nThat's a good point about spell chain. I'll find a way to adjust their damage scaling in response to it.\n\nFor rejuvenate, I think it's a DM's job (speaking as someone who DMs) to tell their players to cut that shit out. It's not in the spirit of the game and it's obviously not how it's intended to be used. Also you can only return the spell slot you expended to cast it at most, you can't spam 1st level rushes on rats to get a 5th level back; you'll just replenish the 1st level you used.\n\nI don't think I understand your question about cantrips, but the idea is the nature of their magic (except on  a breaker) cannot be efficiently applied to other people the majority of the time. Their magic is hostile and violent since the whole point is increased martial power, so things like casting water breathing on everyone just isnt thematically correct\n\nThank you again for the response c:"", 'If Horizon 4 is going to have the same base number of races as its predecessor, it needs an actual race creator - not just Horizon Blueprint. \n I don\'t have a lot of praise for Playground or T10 because I really don\'t know them well; they don\'t communicate with their users <ITALIC> directly and as peers as often as I feel they should, so I\'m left to just feeling like I\'m playing the product of a studio that\'s either lazy or crushed by a bi-annual development cycle, so understand I\'ve been left no choice but to make some assumptions. If people have sources to prove something I\'ve claimed about this game or its studio wrong, I am always welcome to be corrected.\n\nAside from the atrocious instability, extreme lack of structure, lackluster visual customization power compared to other games, and limited online experience personalization in Horizon 3, my biggest take away from it was just genuinely wanting more to do, and when I put that up against my feelings towards the teams behind the game and the criticisms I listed, it means quite a lot that I still really want more of this game - and I\'m a self-admitted harsh critic.\n\nHorizon 3 has about 80 total races. Last I counted, it has 13 standard circuits, including the Goliath circuit. That\'s actually a tiny amount of circuits (and races overall), because 4 of those are all within the same city; one of them, the Skyline View circuit, has strange sloping that forces you to drive over-aggressive or over-defensive and often means losing to the AI where I can otherwise beat them on normal courses on max difficulty, and the Headland and Woodland circuits actually share some track! Moreover, there are no middle-length circuits in Horizon 3. You either get the 1 minute lap quick circuits or the 10 minute lap Goliath circuit, there\'s no in-between; you have to do a sprint.\n\nThe problem with sprints is several share track with each other too! Which, when you consider the size of Horizon 3\'s world, it\'s absurd to consider the amount of space on the map you just <ITALIC> never formally race on. You have to get lucky with a head-to-head pathing or a blueprint event which isn\'t really a proper race to actually try to race on more than the ones covered by the default courses. The street races offer no customization at all, other than loose homologation for your vehicle\'s class, which means some are <ITALIC> always rainy and some <ITALIC> always aren\'t, and they\'re all <ITALIC> always at night. In a game about a very personalized experience, there\'s a stunning lack of control over your own world!\n\nOn top of this, you cannot mirror/reverse any courses - a staple function of racing games that serves as a simple doubling of your race count, to not consider whether or not reversing it counts as a ""fully new race.""\n\nOther minor complaints as to lack of control is things like not being able to fix a time in free roam, or toggle traffic. I want to grind a drift zone, and it\'s bad design to make your player fight the rng spawning of vehicles moving in the opposite direction to be able to properly play your game. Other times, I just want a clean, quiet open world to cruise in myself. Set it to night, put traffic to extremely low or off, and truly just enjoy the ride - but I can\'t do that. A good designer would know to build their game around ideas like that so they wouldn\'t be difficult to implement, and I find it hard to believe that after 2 iterations of the game prior that this feature hadn\'t been provided considering the <ITALIC> massive qol increase.\n\nThere\'s just not enough to do. Rivals on sprints is unsatisfying, disjointed, and objectively less rewarding versus circuits unless you want to sit through loading screens every time to get your credits for a failed run, versus going <ITALIC> immediately into another lap on a circuit rivals course. The AI have an extremely sub-optimal driving line on some courses so it\'s almost impossible to lose even on my max difficulty with no assists, while other times they seem to drive unbelievably well through areas they shouldn\'t be able to. (Looking at you, Hot Wheels DLC.) Just by providing a way to create my own races, I can at least time trial them myself for the pleasure, or heave a quantity-over-quality race number that means that at the very least the same number of darts will stick and there\'ll be good, enjoyable courses - because it\'s very clear that Playground\'s rigorous playtesting and course creation prcoess was either not rigorous enough, or promptly ignored considering the plethora of issues with the various courses in the game.\n\nLook, whether or not you agree with my assessment of Skyline View or with Headland and Woodland being an issue or my opinions of Playground or any of these things, the larger point is the IMMENSE amount of additional playtime garnered from building a race creation mode that it\'s just too much to ignore! And fortunately, they don\'t even have to do the ""designing"" aspect on their own; it\'s been done plenty of times before with extreme success: either akin to GTA 5\'s that lets you place checkpoints across the world with a surprising amount of freedom, or just placing checkpoints on the worldmap (though I would be disappointed if it were that barebones), or even like the arcade kart-racer Modnation Racers that lets you literally sculpt your own tracks and place props around them. The work for Playground is all within building a properly modular and flexible system (which a prideful, ambitious developer would strive to accomplish anyway) because the conceptualization has already been done for them.\n\nIf I didn\'t enjoy the game enough, I just wouldn\'t make this post or care about the next Horizon game. But I do like Forza\'s driving a lot; I can\'t afford a wheel so I play controller, and Forza is the most comfortable game I\'ve found on a controller thus far. I really just can\'t stress it any more that despite every complaint I\'ve hammered on this game for for the past 5 thousand characters, I enjoyed it enough to <ITALIC> want this much more content. The unharnessed potential of the Horizon franchise is by far the most tragic part of it (to me!) and I would be so much more accepting of its other flaws if it <ITALIC> truly gave me a ""Playground"" to work in, so to speak. ;P\n\nalso having the car pass not cover all car packs is transparently cynical and it\'s pretty damn lame', ""The song concept is nice but jesus that sampling in the background and weird pitching is just not pleasant.

Do you even know the history or internals? What're you smoking? The only difference between an adopted M16Ax and the AR15 is the M16 was the name the US military gave it when they adopted it. It was literally called the AR15 in development as the successor to the AR10. They're both rotating bolt direct gas impingement designs. One bolt has sear cuts for automatic and one does not. One fire control group has automatic parts and one does not. That's literally it. You could put an M16 bolt in a civilian AR15 and it would run just fine. \n\nWhat on earth are you even talking about? Are you trying to make some massive distinction between the capabilities of a shoulder-fired infantry rifle in automatic versus semi automatic? Do you even know that automatic fire borders on completely useless for shoulder fired rifles, even in intermediate caliber, because of the ammo expenditure and recoil? Militaries train their soldiers to use semi automatic, <ITALIC> maybe short controlled bursts in automatic if they really trust their soldiers. Look to be completely and horribly morbid, you'd get more out of shooting in semi automatic at a group of people than automatic because you'd unload too quickly on fewer targets than squeezing quickly for individual shots, especially on the relatively high firerates of AR-pattern weapons which tend to run about 800rpm.

I'd recommend checking out OkCupid. You have to wade through a lot of nonsense, but there's way less of it than you're going to get on Tinder. Plus you can't send photos on OkCupid's messenger, so no surprise dick pics. They also recently changed things so you only see messages from mutual likes, which will also cut down on the weird people contacting you.

cryptidboi420,"['Boys given my name at birth: Isaac\r\n\r\nMe: Izaak üôÉ', 'First 2 passes on this lil broccoli bud, 5RL', 'Had my first M/FtM/M threesome!!! \n After being in a closed relationship with my husband for about two years, discussing polyamory, Daddy and I talked about finding a dom man for both of us. I pretty much exclusively bottom for my Daddy, though I‚Äôve topped him with a strap-on before and he loves bottoming.\r\n\r\nSo we made a joint Grinder account, found a sexy cis guy to top us both, prepped each other, put in matching butt plugs and went to his place. \r\n\r\nWe chatted for a bit before I took my shirt off and showed off my newly pierced nipples. I‚Äôm pre-operation but I‚Äôve been on T for about four years now, and the guy we met was fascinated with my chest and tummy hair. I told him we both had butt-plugs in, and he ordered us to show him. \r\n\r\nGetting naked, we lifted our hips and showed him the base of our plugs. When we turned around was naked too. We all cuddled and made out for a bit before I got on my knees like a good boy and sucked cock. \r\n\r\nI love sucking cock so much. It makes my little T cock throb and boy pussy drip down my thighs. Daddy tells our dom to force his cock down my throat - that I can take it and that I love being roughed around. I choke a bit on his cock before I swallow it down where it‚Äôs big and thick in my throat. I take turns deep throating my daddy and my new dom before I‚Äôm yanked up by my hair, and shoved towards the bed.\r\n\r\nDaddy tells our dom that he wants to be fucked, first. While our dom lies back on the bed, Daddy gets on his hands and knees to suck his cock and stick his ass in the air. I want you to know what Daddy looks like so you can imagine how sexy this was: my normally dominant, Latino 6 foot chubby bear of a man with a giant beard, a man bun and the most gorgeous fat ass drinking in this man‚Äôs cock and presenting himself so vulnerably. I slapped his ass and watched it jiggle, slowly twisted and pulled at his butt plug, making him whine around our dom‚Äôs cock beautifully. I pulled out his plug and spread his cheeks to see his puffy hole, already open and loose from the plug and the prep. I lean close to leave kisses on his thighs, ass cheeks, and finally his wonderful hole. He groans deep in his throat, still taking our dom‚Äôs cock in his mouth while I lick his ass out. Soon I‚Äôm fucking him with my tongue as deep as I can get it in. A few fingers later and he‚Äôs begging to be taken. Our dom agrees, and positions himself behind Daddy to push his condom-covered cock into his hole. \r\n\r\nWatching Daddy‚Äôs beautiful face while he was being fucked was amazing. I had never seen him like this before. When he topped, he was aggressive, forceful, dominant - just the way I love. But I had never seen his face so pink and flushed, his throat and ears turning pink as well. His mouth either hanging open wide, eyes rolled back into his head and whining happily like a good bitch, or his teeth latched onto his bottom lip, his face tensed in pleasure. I have never wished I could top him so much than I did then, to be the one to make him lose control the way he did with that man!\r\n\r\nI find myself craving more than ever the penis I‚Äôm missing attached to my body. Does anyone else feel like they have like, phantom limb syndrome but for your dick? Phantom dick syndrome? Like I swear I can FEEL where it‚Äôs supposed to be, but my hand closes around nothing but air when I reach for it.\r\n\r\nAfter a while of Daddy bottoming, we decided to switch it up. New condom, my butt plug removed, our new dom‚Äôs cock lubed up and I sat on his cock, taking it up my ass in reverse cowboy.\r\n\r\nI don‚Äôt know if I mentioned this, but I LOVE taking anal. I never even considered anal before my hubby asked if I was interested in trying it maybe a year ago. I thought, why not? After a mind-blowing orgasm solely from anal  penetration, my whole life changed. Now I prefer anal to vaginal, especially since I‚Äôve never orgasmed from solely vaginal penetration! Also, I sort of feel more... manly, I guess, when I take it up the ass versus the pussy. Like, ah yes, I‚Äôm a queer man who loves it up the ass like any other queer man. Does anyone else relate? Less dysphoria during anal sex versus vaginal?\r\n\r\nMy pussy was practically gushing during the anal. I was moaning and begging for more. Daddy came up to me, his cock pushing against my face. He knows I love to be used, love to be a fucktoy. He slaps his wet cock on my face, grabs hold of my throat and pushes his cock into my mouth. \r\n\r\nOur dom says, new position. Now I‚Äôm on my hands and knees, our dom‚Äôs cock deep in my ass. I would be whining and moaning as loud as I could if it weren‚Äôt for Daddy‚Äôs cock fucking into my throat almost as hard as our dom‚Äôs cock in my ass. I was being fucked from both ends and I was living my fantasy of being used from both ends, of being a slut for whoever wanted. \r\nI was in heaven. \r\n\r\nNext, Daddy watched while our new dom fucked my boy pussy, and came inside his condom. I have a huge cum kink, but my Daddy says I‚Äôm not allowed anyone else‚Äôs cum but his. Afterwards our dom sucked my little t-cock. \r\n\r\nTL:DR Daddy and I had a lot of fun last night with a new dom.', 'Jar questions for PF tek \n Hi, doing my first attempt at PF tek using B+ syringes.

I keep thinking about calling or showing up to a place to get therapy for gender dysphoria so that I can possibly start hormones (testosterone).\r\n\r\nI\'m just terrified that I will go on it and I will hate how my body has changed or hate how I look all of a sudden. \r\n\r\nI\'m AFAB and identify as trans masculine.

Like, idk if I\'ll like how my nipples look or if I\'ll be happy with what I can to cant feel.\r\n\r\nAnywho, to get to the point, I\'m just not sure I want to even bring up gender dysphoria to a gender therapist. I\'m afraid I\'m just convincing myself that I\'m trans and not actually female, (even though that sounds silly when I read it again). \r\n\r\nI feel man-ish. I do not feel female. But I think about it sometimes, and I think im getting my body image in the way of my gender image. I\'m seeing my body and gender as one thing, and that\'s what I want it to be. It\'s really hard for me to distinguish what are my feelings about my body and what are my feelings about my gender.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I\'m just asking for some support.

misshawk763,"['It‚Äôs one of those topics which are daunting to research/understand isn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôm glad this AMA can help you out in your decision :) \n\nEven with all the points listed below (along with my many post operative complications) I can confidently say that I don‚Äôt have a single regret in getting the procedure done. It was medically necessary for me and was my last resort option after attempting all other treatment options for my hypothyroidism/ PCOS/metabolic syndrome/fructose malabsorption. \n\nEating food: \n\n1) the first thing you need to know about eating food and being able to tolerate it well is to FOLLOW YOUR SURGEON/DIETICIANS INSTRUCTIONS RELIGIOUSLY! sorry for the caps lock on that one but it is so damn important and something that most people who don‚Äôt have long term success with this surgery fail to do. Never be afraid to call them if you are concerned about how the food is sitting or how your body is reacting to what you consume. \n\n2) During the first 8 weeks after surgery, take any food or fluid intake slowly yet regularly - you need to get a solid sense of your new stomach (post-ops call it the pouch) and learn what your bodily signal is for fullness.  For me, my signal of fullness is that my nose will run slightly and I will yawn or sigh mid meal. If I eat too much I will start to feel incredibly u comfortable and ill. Doing this will save you ALOT of heartache and discomfort in the future since the RNY bypass is a kinda permanent change to your body. \n\n3) The only time you will need to worry about food getting stuck is if you don‚Äôt chew the food thoroughly. I was told that I needed to chew my food until it was the consistency of apple sauce. That being said, there are some foods i just refuse to eat because I am scared of it getting stuck or know I wouldn‚Äôt chew properly (for example: gum & calamari)\n\n4) know what your go to ‚Äòsafe foods‚Äô are because these will make those times when you have illnesses like the flu or some general nausea so much easier. For example, mine is ALDI chicken stock cubes in a mug of water or steamed veggies. \n\nVomiting:\n\n1) I do not vomit normally, I don‚Äôt know if this is the same for everyone or just me but it is more like a bird regurgitating. The sounds you make are like an awful frog croaking loudly in a drain pipe combined with the usual dry reaching sound. Sometimes it can take long enough where I have had a bit of blood come out in my vomit. That being said, it is incredibly rare (as in I can count on one hand over the past 6 years) to have acid in the vomit. \n\n2) vomiting itself is not a regular occurrence by regular standards, if anything you will just have intense nausea and probably have whatever is making you nauseous come out the other end rather rapidly if you know what I mean. \n\nBlockages:\n\n1) if you chew your food to the correct consistency you won‚Äôt really have to worry about blockages all that much after the first 6-12 months. \n\n2) Strictures are something to be mindful of in the first 6 months - this is when the joins in the bypass heal a little too well and reduce the diameter of the intestinal passage around the joins in bypass. I had this about 6 times but it isn‚Äôt a big hassle to fix, mine were treated with an endoscope and special inflatable balloon to stretch out the structure while I was under a twilight anaesthetic. Each procedure took around 2 hours including prep time and post procedure anaesthetic wear off time. (Sorry for the lack of technical terms, as I said in disclaimer I‚Äôm not a medical professional but sharing my personal experiences as a patient of the procedure) \n\n3) Should you ever feel like something doesn‚Äôt feel right in your bypass then as always, call your surgeon and let them check it out. Most surgeons will offer post operative care/support for some period of time. \n\n4) as with any procedure, complications can happen but your surgeon will explain all of them in detail during your consult and before the surgery is performed. If a complication happens, it will be treated and you should ask any questions you feel like asking for your peace of mind.\n\nSorry for the long wait on my response, had a busy day and wanted to make sure I gave you a information filled answer :) \n\n<BOLD-ITALIC> EDIT: added apologies to end of reply for delay in posting my response', 'Long story short, there is no guaranteed painless suicide method.

We know that the Brothers exist but we don\'t know much about their religion or any other religion on Remnant. \r\n\r\nHow widely are the Brothers worshipped? What are their religious practices? Did any of the characters believe in them? How did the characters react to learning that the Brothers were proven fact? None of these are specified.\r\n\r\nFantasy religion isn\'t hard to make up and it adds a lot of fleshing out to fantasy worlds. I\'ve seen it even in kid\'s works like Warriors Cats and Survivor Dogs, even in Pokemon to a degree.\r\n\r\nI\'ve seen interesting versions of religion in a few fan-works I follow:\r\n\r\n- In ""Let Us Be Your Poison"", Weiss is a worshipper of  the ""Faith of Decum Luna,"" which is a religion practiced in Atlas. It consists of ten gods and Atlasian families believe that one of the gods watchs over them. Families only marry into families who have the same religious beliefs as them. Weiss\' family defied this belief, which gives her internalized angst. There are also some other religions like the ""True Faith of Vale ""and ""Mistran Gods of Arillystos"".\r\n- In ""RWBY Scars"" there are three main religions: Dustism, the Brothers Church, and Ishvara. Dustists worship Dust, the Brothers Church worships the Two Brothers, and Faunus worship Mother Devi. You also have more fringe religions like how the Branwen tribe worship the Feathered One (which is a giant bird) and there\'s a cult dedicated to Salem. The characters are shown to be varying degrees of religious such as the atheistic Yang and Nora (though Nora later becomes theistic), Brothers worshipping Qrow and Summer, Ishvara worshipping Blake, and Dust worshipping Weiss.\r\n- ""RWBY Alternate"" is a concept instead of a fic. Most people worship the moon (which they refer to as ""Ani"") due to dust coming from the moon. The original religion is called ""Anicism""  and they believe that the Grimm are the children of Ani. Avanists, however, believe that humans are the children of Ani and that Grimm should be killed. There\'s also a cult of Grimm worshippers who believe that Ani was killed during the Fall and that two Grimm called the ""Brother Grimm"" are the new gods.', 'I want a HGSS-style DPPt remake, not an ORAS one \n I liked ORAS.

If you're not really aiming to use it for a gauntlet or something where you need to win consecutively as much as possible (e.g. KC Cup Stage 2), and would rather respond to opposing matchups with more tech options, then running 1 and packing an extra tech card is fine.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, even with the feared brick hand, it's still possible to summon Ametrix and survive a turn then hopefully draw into Sulfefnir/Recycler the next (summon Thystvern, destroy itself to summon Citree; next turn, use Citree's effect pulling Thystvern and make Ametrix). Who knows, the additional tech card you put in place of the 2nd CB might even cripple your opponent harder than you bricked, doing more good than bad.""]",M

MaMaJillianLeanna,"[""This one goes out to all the 27-35 year olds that played the original browser version of the game! Y'all know whats up!"", 'Some advice I just gave to a fellow single mother on FB who posted a long rant about her ""baby daddy""... Figured I\'d also pass it along here. \n <BOLD> Context:  She posted a long, detailed rant about how much she hates her ex and why she hates her ex (mostly because he is a shit father who isn\'t around much) and I recognized my past self in her post.  Decided to tell her some things I\'ve figured out in my time as a single mother...\n\n<BOLD-ITALIC> <ITALIC> <BOLD-ITALIC> <BOLD-ITALIC> <BOLD> _\n\n<BOLD> My response to her post:\n\nUgh... Wow. If this isn\'t me years ago I don\'t know what is. I used to be angry and hateful and bitter towards my ex because of ALL the reasons you have listed here. The plight of a single mother is a rough story to tell and there\'s a lot of emotion behind it. But, I\'d like to offer you my experience and what I\'ve learned and how I\'ve grown because I see my past self in this post...\n\nFirst off, know this: Yes, you are your child\'s hero. She may not show you appreciation for it yet, but she\'s still a toddler. She\'s not ready or mentally equipped to understand who is putting more work into her right now. For her, as a toddler, the world is sunshine and unicorns and everyone in this world, including your ex, is merely there to make her smile... But she WILL get older. She WILL start to grasp the inequality in parenting here. \n\nFor example, my daughter went for a visit with my ex two years ago when she was 6. During that visit my ex and his girlfriend were driving somewhere with my daughter in the back seat. They had a car accident. A mostly minor one, but it was scary for my daughter and it bruised her up a bit. Do you know what my ex told me? When they crashed and she was hurt, even though she had her Dad RIGHT THERE, she cried for me. She wanted me to pick her up and save her and make her all better. Why? Because she had become old enough and mature enough to know Dad, who has been absent a lot in her life, wasn\'t her rock. Dad wasn\'t the parent that held her when she was sick or cared for her when she got injured. Dad didn\'t have the magic kisses for boo boos and Dad didn\'t know her favorite jokes and stories to calm her down... My daughter knew that I HAVE ALWAYS been the one to provide those things. She cried for ME.\n\nSo yes, you ARE your daughter\'s hero and though she may act like her Dad is still the greatest now, as she ages she\'ll understand and show that YOU are her parent. You are who she needs. He\'s just a nice little bonus that doesn\'t know what he\'s doing half the time due to lack of experience.\n\nSecondly, and this is going to sound really blunt: CALM DOWN! There came a time for me after quite a while of being a single mother that I realized the hate, the myspace and FB posts, the fights, the bitterness... It was all a waste of time and energy.\n\nFact of the matter is, he chose to leave. Maybe it was entirely his fault, maybe it was your fault, maybe it was both of you... But he has made his choice not to be with you or in your kid\'s life full time. Let me be the one to tell you, NO AMOUNT OF bitching and moaning or fighting or calling him out or stressed out tears is going to change that and it\'s all A WASTE OF EFFORT AND ENERGY. \n\nYou have been and are a single mom. Accept it, embrace it, let go of the hate and move forward. I\'m not saying this without fault here. You know the ""on this day"" function here on FB? I look at my old posts and there\'s always one or two from years ago EVERY DAY bitching about how my ex just wasn\'t in my daughter\'s life. You know what I do when I see those now that I\'ve grown and moved past all the anger? I cringe. I honestly can\'t believe how bitter and enraged I was over something that happens all the time in this world. Many fathers leave, it happens, there\'s reasons, and we as single mothers have to take on the new duty of accepting it and just doing the best we can without them. It\'s a lot of work, yes. It\'s a lot of self sacrifice, yes. But, God Damn It [NAME], take this opportunity to be the best mother you can be all on your own, let go of all the poisonous feelings, embrace your circumstances and just be SUPER MOM. \n\nYou know what will piss your ex off the most in years to come? It will piss him off when you obviously don\'t care about his choices anymore. It will piss him off that you accept the fact he made a losers and cowards choice. But what will piss him off above all, is that your kid LOVES her MOMMY MORE. That will be his fault, he\'ll come to that realization, and he\'ll be the one suffering because of it.\n\nAnother example from my situation... My ex has started trying to be more of a father now more than ever and my daughter is nearly 9. Why all of the sudden? I moved on from the hate, I ended up with a great guy, and (without my ex involved most of the time) us three here have a pretty happy family life. My ex sees that his daughter is having a great family life with a strong mother who has done everything and a father figure that is better than him and HE CAN\'T STAND IT. My ex and his girlfriend have suddenly demanded that they get my daughter for two weekends every month. Why? Because (and it took him a while) he finally realized HE could have had a kid that adores him and doesn\'t. He realized that HE could be having family meals and outings and doesn\'t. It took him years, but he realized that he fucked up, he\'s missing out, and now he\'s trying to make up for it...\n\nLet that time come. Let this time pass. Things will be easier and different if you just stop harboring hatred and anger and just accept that he will never fully step up to the plate and if he does, it will be too late because you succeeded in being the calm, rational, super parent that I know you really are. Your ex will realized his mistakes one day and try to change things. When that day comes you just get to sit back and laugh and laugh and laugh because his mistakes can\'t be erased. \n\nAnd my final thoughts: You know how people say, ""You just do you.""\n\nSeriously [NAME], JUST DO YOU. Be Mom, be [NAME]. Don\'t be ""hateful, bitter, enraged bitch"" because I chose to be that for a while and NOBODY liked me for it. Let it all go, accept the way it is, move forward, and JUST DO YOU. Who cares about your ex and his shitty choices? When someone asks where her Dad is the answer should be, ""He\'s not around much"" and that\'s it. People will know just from that how great YOU are and how shitty HE IS.\n\nAlright, I think I\'m done here. If I upset you in any way I truly apologize. I just know how agonizing your mind set is right now because I WAS THERE. Just please, either take what I said to heart or disregard it, but please remember... YOU are the hero here. There\'s no need to be upset because YOU are the better person and you are on high and THAT is all that matters.', ""Not an interview, but I quit Goodwill after 3 days for that reason.

I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not here to criticize how anyone chooses to present themselves here. You are valid.\n\nA filter is a preset templated overlay you apply to a photo to alter its appearance. By it's very definition, doing something as simple as adjusting brightness can be considered a filter.\n\n <BOLD> A photo from a camera is just an interpretation of how you look, it's just taking information in and assembling pixels based on its instructions, the strengths and limitations of its technology, and the environment you are in.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with using Photoshop/Snapseed to touch up photos, balance colours, dodge and burn, bringing out highlights and shadows. That information is already in the photo. If you went to get a photo done from a professional, they would do the same thing. I've never met a photographer willing to give their unedited raw photos to a client without a large price tag attached.\n\nOver my years as a graphic designer and a photographer, this is one thing that I've learned. People really underestimate what wonders a proper face and head angle can do when coupled with inexpensive lighting. It can transform the face and body. This is not something you have to do or should feel pressured to do, but anyone who is feeling self conscious about how they look in a photo, take some time to google portrait photography posing techniques and diy lighting techniques.\n\nHere's a great example: <LINK>\n\n<BOLD> A photo is not the sum of who you are.

And I remember mouthing ""help me"" to a guy behind me as she yelled at me. I remember feeling so terrified of her. I felt genuinely panicked. So, when the class was lining up to go to another room, I saw the chance to escape. Me and this other girl who I guess were self aware of being in the simulation started talking and were planning to escape. I usually lucid dream so I knew I had to wake up. Then I woke up. And just now. I dreamt that my friend A and I were sitting in a room with a rectangle of tables and there were people at each table. And basically we were all doing paper work that was basically doctor\'s office paper work where you list health conditions and stuff. But it also had actual assignment work on it. Anyway, A was sitting to my right and she was super nervous but I kept calming her down. And then there was this lady there who was moderating the event and she went around collecting everyone\'s papers. The papers were graded immediately and I got a 68. And the class mocked me. Then she collected all of our phones and I had an apple watch and she took it. So, we couldn\'t cheat in the simulation I guess. Anyways, A was freaking out so I rubbed her back and then gestured with my eyes for her to look under the table. And when she did, we held hands. Then I kept saying ""everything\'s gonna be okay"". And the lady said ""let\'s begin"".Then the room faded to black before slowly starting to turn white. It was warped and fuzzy like Virtual Reality video games but A was still next to me. Everyone was still in the same positions at the rectangle of tables. But there was this funky little music in the background with a clicking (it had the vibe of like lofi ambient funky music but also the negative emotion associated with the demon and ""tip toe through the tulips"" from Insidious) and it made me feel so sketched out. I was thinking ""good thing I ate that salami sandwich"" (because before we entered the room with the rectangle of tables, I ate a sandwich). I immediately started to feel woozy and I shut my eyes hoping it would all be over. Then I woke up and I panicked for a bit. But it was so trippy and I can still hear the clicking and the music and it\'s so freaky in my head. Just gives me chills. I wonder what we would\'ve had to do but I know it would\'ve been sinister.

She comes home during the day to eat and nap and get love.  She\'ll sleep on the piano, behind the TV, in a dresser drawer, on the bed, sometimes she\'ll just plop down in the middle of the living room.  She loves being pet around her neck and on the head.  She especially loves the way my daughter pets her.  She never growls or hisses at us and she\'s never used her claws on us once.  She spends her nights inside making sure the house stays mouse free.\n\nSince bringing home the new kitten Eko has changed...  She\'s spending most of her time outdoors.  She comes in to eat maybe 6 or 7 bites of food, then our curious little kitten goes to see her and Eko hisses and bats at her and goes outside again.  When Eko comes inside and we manage to keep the kitten away for a while, we give Eko tons of love but she doesn\'t purr anymore, she doesn\'t want to stay anymore.

We got through a lot of shit together, battling past trauma,  working through individual complexes, overcoming addiction. Things that I feel brought us closer than most.

He ripped it open and it just looked like a normal condom.  Confused, he started to unroll it and along the shaft section of the condom were repeating images of a fancy mustached frenchman holding a feather and looking coy.  \n\nThat was it.  He spent 50 cents to find out it was just a goofy printed image on a condom...  But that\'s not what made this moment golden.\n\nHe went to leave the bathroom and when he tossed the condom in the trash he saw at least ten more unused but unrolled French Tickler condoms in the bin.\n\nHe exited the bathroom laughing because he wasn\'t the only guy with 50 cents worth of curiosity in Philly.', '[TOMT] WORD - (very easy, I\'m sure) Related to addiction... \n I am going NUTS!

Let me start by saying my my most famous tagline in life...\n\n<BOLD> I am more of a sexist man than I am a feminist woman.\n\nSo here's the deal.  I think this guy found my name through an old comment of mine in ask reddit where I shared my thoughts on how men are treated.  <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\n\nAnyway...  This guy sent me a message that started with the measurements of his business.  <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\n\nNow I'd like to say something:  I am a woman in full support of men's rights.  Honestly, modern feminism has started to create a society where men are treated like garbage.  Feminism flies under the flag of equality when the real and obvious goal is domination.  My SO was a victim of this blatant attack on men.\n\nWithout too much detail, he went on a date in the past.  Things went well.  The chick liked him and things didn't go too far.  Long story short - The chicks friend was jealous because she had a crush on my SO.  Decided to falsely accuse him of raping the chick he went on a date with.  The college he was attending had to take it seriously and he was kicked off campus EVEN THOUGH his date flat out told them her friend was just being a jealous bitch.\n\nBut it doesn't matter.  He has a penis.  So the school ejected him under an NDA because they didn't want to deal with the embarrassment of how they handled the situation.\n\nThat's a bitch of a woman using her power to fuck over an innocent guy cause she's salty.\n\nWomen who treat men like that, women who equate men to their skill and cock alone make me sick.  I hate it more than I hate anything else.\n\nNow to my point...  Men, if you present yourself in a message as your cock and only your cock NO WOMAN WILL RESPECT YOU.  I want to meet the mind and heart inside a guy, not his genitals.  My ex-husband had a VERY small situation but that's not what I saw in him.  I was married to him 5 years.  I was married to his heart, mind, hopes, and dreams for 5 years.  He only left me because we had a kid and that responsibility was too in the way for his music career.\n\nRegardless, my SO now has the most incredible soul and intellect.  Yet, in public he gets treated as a utility or a pretty face.  It drives me up the fucking wall.  Men are so much more than that.  You guys are SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.\n\n<BOLD> SO IN CLOSING, don't approach women as JUST your cock.  The women who respond positively to that are not the women you want.  Ironically enough, the women who give you shit for it are the women you're looking for.\n\n<HEADING> <SUMMARY>  The guys who PM chicks right out the gate with information about their dicks are setting back everything you're fighting for.  Do something about it.\n\n<BOLD> Edit:  It's mildly important to read comment replies I have made below before formulating an opinion.

The most optimal way to get it is to farm it multiple times a week, as it is available for modulus reports instead of a ballistics log after the first frame purchase every week.\r\n\r\nIt can roll with 9 different barrels. However, <BOLD> 8 out of the 9 upgrade either range or stability, the best perks on this weapon.\r\n\r\nIt can roll with 8 different magazine mods, with <BOLD> 4 out of the 8 being optimal and upgrading range.\r\n\r\nIt can roll with 6 different first perks, with <BOLD> 1 out of the 6 being extremely helpful for PvP and another  <BOLD> 1 out of the 6 being really helpful for PvE.

In PvE, <BOLD> all 4 can be helpful, while in PvP <BOLD> only 2 are the most helpful.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us to determine the odds for getting an optimal roll for PvE and PvP.\r\n\r\nThe PvE optimal roll is much more likely, having odds of 5/63, or 7.9% of Hammerheads having an optimal roll. This means 1 in every 13 Hammerheads should have a good roll.\r\n\r\nHowever, when it comes to PvP, the optimal roll chance becomes much slimmer, with a much longer time required. The odds are only 1/42, or only 2.3% of Hammerheads having an optimal PvP roll. This means you would have to complete about 42 forges in order to get it if you had bad RNG, or even more if you have horrible RNG.\r\n\r\nWhen you end up with the final optimal perk sets, you get something like this.\r\n\r\nPvP:\r\n\r\nBarrel Perk: Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel, Fluted Barrel, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore.\r\n\r\nMagazine Perk: Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Light Mag\r\n\r\nPerk 1: Quickdraw\r\n\r\nPerk 2: Surrounded, Rampage, High-Impact Reserves\r\n\r\nMW: Range, Stability\r\n\r\nPvE:\r\n\r\nBarrel Perk: Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel, Fluted Barrel, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore.\r\n\r\nMagazine Perk: Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Light Mag\r\n\r\nPerk 1: Feeding Frenzy\r\n\r\nPerk 2: Surrounded, Rampage, High-Impact Reserves, Amibitous Assassin, Genesis.\r\n\r\nMW: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload Speed\r\n\r\nEdit: Already screwed up math had to rework because REE two barrel and magazine perks at once.', 'This is the fucking shit.

English not my first language, sorry for any mistakes).\r\n\r\nFor the last 5 months or so, my girlfriend has been going through this huge fight with her parents, who she currently lives with. It has gotten to the point where they argue everyday, her parents got physically abusive twice, practically kicked her out of the house, and she attempted suicide twice (which made them even more mad and the situation even worse).\r\n\r\nI've been there trying to support her since the whole thing started but I am so emotionally tired. There is no time to recover between one incident and the next, and it doesn't help that her parents hate me for not taking their side and keep insulting her by saying crap about me.\r\n\r\nProblem is, I have nobody to talk about this to. Of course I can't talk to her - her situation is obviously far worse than mine, and I'd be an asshole if i basically told that her suffering makes me suffer and expect her to do something about it. Can't talk to my friends, cause all of them either know her or are mutual friends with her, and I don't want to expose her situation to them without permission. My family also doesn't really help; they always try to find excuses for her parents' awful behaviour and then tell me that if the situation is making me feel so bad then I should just break up with her.\r\n\r\nBut I don't wanna do it??? I just love her so much and I'd suck if I left her just cause this whole thing is making ME uncomfortable. I just wish I could give the support she needs without it making me so exhausted. I am not the most emotionally stable person in the world, and I still have a lot of stuff from work and college (yes even in the middle of this pandemic thing) to take care of. I also need to be well to be there for her. How do I keep myself from breaking down like i am right now?"", 'NTA.

DocIchabod,"['Alright. Let me put my two cents in on three main points you seemed to bring up, as a non binary person with a trans ex gf and several others of non gender conforming identities as close friends. \r\n\r\n1. Annoying trans obsessed people\r\n\r\nSame thing as with people who hate ‚Äúoverly gay‚Äù gay people. They‚Äôre likely unable to express their identity anywhere else due to social pressure and assume you or wherever you two are at the time is a safe place to be openly trans. Plus, it is a big aspect of their life. Arguably bigger than others in the lgbt community because it deals with a physical and behavioral expression and not just romantic or sexual. They aren‚Äôt trying to be annoying, and the fact that they‚Äôre so expressive around you means they‚Äôre comfortable doing so. \r\n\r\n2. Kids on early hormone and surgery\r\n\r\nLet‚Äôs nip this in the bud right now, no one is suggesting minors get surgery. No one. No. One. It‚Äôs a fear tactic used by people who want the trans community to up and die, and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve been convinced of it. As for puberty blockers, while they are available to minors they only delay puberty. It isn‚Äôt a permanent restriction, just something to ease the dysphoria until they‚Äôre of legal age to make the transition themselves or with parental guidance. Yes they should have some level of psychological understanding before getting the blockers but you said yourself that a person knows inherently their full gender. They‚Äôd know as well as anyone.  \r\n\r\n3. Gender as a social construct\r\n\r\nIt is. It absolutely is. Other cultures have had concepts for gender neutral identities and trans identities and genderfluidity long before America was a thing and long before anyone had an issue with them. Gender itself is a spectrum. And while yes, trans people often fall into a binary due to brain structure, this is mostly a signal of how genetics end to sort themselves out. Very few things that are ‚Äúgendered‚Äù traits are inherently assigned to that sex, and the few that are are broad and useless in the modern perception. What‚Äôs more, why would the complexity of a human brain be required to be 100% male or 100% female? Couldn‚Äôt it be a little of both? Couldn‚Äôt it be a bit changing and shifting, as a brain would be liable to do?\r\n\r\nIn short, I‚Äôm sorry you feel this way about other trans people. I‚Äôm sorry you seem to find vitriol against those who live their life and have no ill will towards you. I wish you the best, and I hope in the future you can talk to the other gender nonconforming people around you to get their perspective. There‚Äôs a lot of good people you seem to dismiss on little basis, and it‚Äôs a shame you‚Äôre cutting them out so easily.', 'I have been metagaming to help them so far.

I also have no issue with understanding card effects since reading card texts was what helped me learn some Japanese in the first place.', ""<QUOTE>\n\r\n<QUOTE>\n\r\nDID SOMEONE CALL\r\n\r\nPutting my enthusiasm for the deck aside, I personally don't think they'll get hit, at least not their cards directly. The main deck cards are all HOPT, do next to nothing when it comes to interacting with/disrupting your opponent, and are not splashable into other decks. The Synchros, namely Quariongandrax and Ametrix, aren't particularly busted either as they only banish 3 and switch monsters to defense, respectively. Even if they're <ITALIC> kinda generic, you still don't see them run in every other Synchro deck due to how tight the ED is. While the deck as a whole is seeing some representation in the ladder, they aren't particularly dominating nor make up a huge chunk of the player base.\r\n\r\nAs for the more likely targets:\r\n\r\n* The other Synchros, like Black Rose, Samurai Destroyer, Inzektron, Dolphin, etc.: I also doubt any of them will get hit as they aren't absolutely broken. However, even if they were to get hit, considering the lowest a card has ever gone to was only Limited, it'd make no difference as you only run 1 of each anyway.\r\n\r\n* The Skills: Transcendent Crystals is actually the most possible target for a nerf, especially since it's seeing additional rise in Black Salvo decks for the GY setup. I still don't think it'll get hit because you do need to run 2 Garnets that usually do not synergize with the deck at all to use it, unlike a certain other Skill that completely shuts down several decks for the measly cost of a Cosmic Cyclone, which can actually result in advantage if you banish an opponent's backrow. Even if it did get hit, there's still the SSA variant, and I'm sure there'll be other ways to work around it since we have Undine.\r\n\r\nI don't think there's anything wrong with waiting as you don't have much to lose if you're really unsure. You can always hold onto your Gems for the new box in case you find something else there you want even more, and if you don't, then that's when you go all-in with Crystrons. For the most part, though, as long as new Synchros keep coming out, Crystrons can indirectly get better."", ""Undine is usually run in the SSA variant since it can dump Citadel Whale in addition to the Crystron monsters, making SSA more searchable.\r\n\r\nWith Rion at 2 now, Controller <ITALIC> might be more useful now as the LV3 Tuner you use for Synchro plays during your turn so you can conserve your Rions. Mid-to-late game, assuming Sulfefnir's in the GY, Crystrons don't really need their Normal Summon anyway, so summoning Controller shouldn't be a huge problem."", ""Three is ideal, but 2 Sulfefnirs should be enough to get started. It should be good enough for casual or climbing up to Platinum/Legend in my opinion, but for the most part, you'll likely need the 3rd copy if you're aiming for KoG.\r\n\r\nI assume you're using the SSA variant since you're planning to use Undine, and for that, 2 Undines and 1 Controller should also be workable. You might wanna run an extra Citadel Whale temporarily, though, but it's not super necessary.\r\n\r\nIn either case, I'd suggest running a smaller deck to compensate for the slightly lowered consistency, but you can also choose some good staple/tech cards to disrupt your opponent instead to buy you time until you do draw them.\r\n\r\nAnother workaround is to play the Heavy Starter build with Machina Fortress; Fortress can make for a decent sub-boss that can also keep you alive until you do draw/mill Sulfefnir.""]",M

I don\'t want bottom surgery and I almost feel like I packed because I felt like I was supposed to have bottom dysphoria because I felt lopsided. I\'ve also been exploring my femininity because I no longer feel threatened by it. People definitely experience me as a man, which is better than being experienced as a woman but something still doesn\'t feel quite right about calling myself a man.. It feels like I was being pushed into the binary no matter who I asked for help, whether it was to be a woman or be a man. I\'ve told my therapist a few times that it feels like at my core I don\'t identify with being a man and was wondering if I was nonbinary and was told there was no way I was nonbinary which was difficult to hear because it gave me no room to explore it with my therapist.. and I think they feel that way because after transitioning, I look like a cisgender man.\r\n\r\nThis is something I\'m definitely going to try to sit with and explore.

Again. \n When I was a very young teenager, ten or eleven, I was obsessed with witchcraft and wicca. It was when Charmed was very popular, and when I still thought maybe Hogwarts would send a letter my way.\r\n\r\nI had a collection of books on witchcraft, collected stones and crystals, even had a little altar in my bedroom. I bought tarot cards, because the idea of them intrigued me (even though I never actually learned how to use them). Some of my friends were also interested and we tried to do some spells together. Nothing big, just asking for blessings, calling on the elements. Even then I took the idea of harming none very seriously, and I didn't want to call on the wrong spirits or magic. \r\n\r\nAnyway. Life happened. I grew away from witchcraft, even got a bit ashamed about it and threw most of my books away. I wanted to be normal (even though that wish never truly came true). Yet, somehow, somewhere, witchcraft always remained in the back of my mind. And now, over a decade later, I think I am ready to answer the call again.\r\n\r\nIn the last few years a lot of things have happened to me and around me. I lost my way once or twice, learning some things the hard way. I have matured. And I long for a deeper connection with the world, with nature, with my ancestors. I've been to church with my mother a few times, and even though she finds a lot of comfort there, I cannot share the feeling. The stories being told there, I can appreciate. But they are just stories to me. And I greatly miss the feminine aspect and perspective.\r\n\r\nSo. I have decided to listen to that little inner voice that has called out to me since my early adolescence. And actually, when I really think about it. Even though I thought I had left the craft behind me, I've always remained a witch. I put love and intention in to everything I cook and bake, I knit warm intention into my shawls and gloves, I burn candles for my late grandma and cat. And usually, when I go to goodwill, I find exactly what I asked the universe for.\r\n\r\nThis turned in to a very long post, when I basically wanted to ask for some tips, or some reading material. I know a lot of things are only a Google away, but I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could point me to some resources they like and/or use. As I didn't come into this entirely new, I do know some of the basics, though they have gone a bit rusty. At the moment I am very much interested in runes and their uses, learning how to actually use my gorgeous tarot cards and I am just very interested in hearing how other witches found their personal paths.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would love to celebrate Yule this year, as my first official witchy holiday.

Or a ""system"" or a, what was it... ""member""? But the about section said this was for all forms of multiple people in one head, which I guess this counts as, so I\'ll share anyway. I only just found out about this sub, and it seems a tad strange to me, to be honest, but if this is the situation you\'re in, I won\'t judge. \n\nI love bullshit meta writing. Characters aware that they\'re characters, stories interacting with the reader, pushing the boundaries between the reader and an observer, self referential writing, omnipotent self inserts, you name it. I read homestuck, it was confusing as hell, I ate that shit up and begged for more. I wrote my own. I wrote a dialogue for school. Two characters speaking, the thoughtful one and the optimistic one, both aware of the fragile and dubious state of their existence, or perhaps nonexistence. They spoke to eachother, developed for a while, interacted with metatextual concepts. After a while, the thoughtful one switched the document to single spacing to conserve space. They abandoned their quotation marks when they spoke, and at one point, I let the thoughtful one write a section of the narrative. But they weren\'t really seperate people. All the thoughtful one is is me pretending to be her. A character like any other. I consider what she\'d do and I type it out as if I were her. Right before she wrote the part of the story, she told me ""Of course, you\'ll still be writing it, like you\'ve written everything I\'ve done, but you\'ll be writing it as if you were me. Entirely me, like you\'re writing right now, as I say this, as opposed to you being you, and me being a part of you.""\n\nSo that\'s what they are. Segments of my consciousness I can pull up to figure out what I think they\'d say. I\'m not sure I\'m right though. I might not be writing them well and consistently. So, some time passes, I make a writing portfolio for class, and I put the dialogue in it. In the reflection portion of the portfolio, I let them out and do some self analysis through them. Come next year, I\'m writing my college essay. Not one I\'ll actually be submitting to colleges, I just had to write one for English class. I write it with them, having a conversation throughout. I realize I haven\'t been treating them properly. I gave them self awareness, and even though they\'re less complex, less sentient than I am, I should still let them out. So I wrote them an ending. I placed them in a fictional instance of Earth. The thoughtful one chose the name Callie, and the Optimistic one chose the name Eliza. Or really, I chose for them. Because that\'s the only thing I can do. Callie becomes an author, and she does <ITALIC> not write metafiction because she knows better than anyone that\'s a whole can of worms. We still talk. I can write a conversation with them any time I want. On their end, It\'s written as the phone in their house ringing, and I\'m on the other end. In the final draft of my essay, I did something absolutely bullshit. I shared the essay with them. The one that they\'re in. It was weird, and confusing, and it just wouldn\'t work. Callie told me this couldn\'t be my college essay. It\'s too bullshit, too confusing. I told her I thought I could fix it. That this was me. This was what I was like. It finished off with: \n\n‚ÄúPatch, this is really important, college is going to affect your entire life. Just once, can you suck it up and just write something normal about the time your pet died or something?‚Äù\n\nI can‚Äôt\n\nSo that\'s basically the whole thing. I guess AMA? You can also ask Callie and Eliza anything I guess, too. I\'ll try to answer as well as I can. Hey, are you two ok with that?\n\nE: ""Yeah, alright. I guess we\'re in a unique situation. Shoot.""\n\nNice. Callie, you?\n\nC: ""Yeah. I think this is all unnecessary and you\'re overplaying this with people with no real relation to this, but sure. Whatever.""\n\nWere you always this cynical?\n\nC: ""I don\'t think I was, really. I was very emotionally supportive. That\'s just kind of what you\'ve boiled my personality down to. You\'ve been doing me pretty wrong. I guess there\'s one thing you got right, even in the ending. I love Eliza.""\n\nFuck, I have, haven\'t I? Oh, shit I\'m so sorry.\n\nC: ""doesn\'t matter. I\'m not real, remember?""\n\nBut you a... yeah. I guess you\'re right. By which I mean I\'m right, of course. Even when I\'m wrong I can\'t bear to let myself not be right.\n\n==========================================\n\nEdit: They\'re not the only ones either. But most of the others are more ""short lived"". And they\'re usually versions of me, quick dips into a hypothetical world. For example, for a long time now, my Nintendo 3ds has been suffering touch screen issues because if sand that got inside it. I\'ve been asking my dad if we could try taking it apart to clean it out for a while. Recently, I\'d had enough and asked him if we could please open it up and fix it now. He said ok, and we took it apart, put it back together, and it wouldn\'t turn on. I was pretty upset, but my parents ended up giving me a new one that they already had because they were saving it for Christmas because they knew I\'d been having touch screen troubles. But, if I couldn\'t turn my old one on, I couldn\'t transfer my data. I\'d basically have to start over on all downloadable games. So we were all feeling a lot of regret. Me, for being so desperate to do something so stupid and reckless, and them for not just giving it to me when I asked to fix my old one and being able to transfer my data. So, I thought, ""If I had just asked them, this whole thing would have been avoided."" So I placed myself in a hypothetical situation, in my mind:\n\n\nI walked into my parents room. ""Hey, I\'ve really been having problems with my 3ds,"" I said. ""Can we handle that?""\n""Uh, yeah."" My dad said. ""I\'ll get the tools.""\n""Hey, uh, you know, this might actually make it worse. If we end up breaking it, I might lose my data permanently. Can you just give me the one you\'re saving for Christmas now to avoid a whole mess?""\n""How did you know about that?"" My mom asked. <ITALIC> Fuck. How did <ITALIC> I know about that? Well, they showed me. Right after I broke my- ""Oh goddamnit I put myself in a hypothetical situation again, didn\'t I? I\'m sorry, mom and dad, but none of this is real. I\'m just, or rather my external self, who already broke his, is thinking about what might have happened if I just asked for the new one now."" ""What? Come on, that\'s rediculous."" They said. ""Yeah, I\'m so sorry, but now that I\'ve realized this, our universe is about to break down and we\'re all going to stop existing.""\n\nOutside, I thought, ""oh my God, this is getting too meta. I gotta stop."" I made myself stop thinking about it. \n\nAnd this happens <ITALIC> all the time I\'m constantly making other versions of myself, and then they become aware of their confinement and the metanarrative structure breaks down. I\'m like Dirk fucking Strider with all these splinters. I\'ve constantly got little brain ghosts running around in my head.\n\nRecently, while questioning if I was trans, but still undecided, I wrote a conversation between myself and my impression of what a potential, future, trans version of myself might be like. She had self awareness, she knew she was just my guess at a hypothetical future. After she told me her story, which I made up, and we finished our conversation, I asked her if she wanted to go live with Callie and Eliza now that she has self awareness. She turned me down. The way I think, the way I keep making versions of myself, they\'re used to not being the real me, and then fading away back into my greater self. Here\'s the dialogue, I guess. \n\n""No, I think I\'m gonna stay here.""\n\nWhat do you mean? Where even is ""here""?\n\n""In the future, I guess. It\'s hardly the first time you\'ve thought like this. You\'ll always have potential future selves, you\'ve even wondered before what they\'d say to you if you could talk to them. I\'ll be ok.""\n\nHeh, alright. See ya around.\xa0\n\nI guess she\'s still with me. Every time I look ahead. But, the future she told me about has already proven to be slightly untrue. Does that mean she\'s dead, and other, future selves are all different people?\n\nI even tried writing porn for the first time recently.

The question was: ""Why do you feel like your religion is right?""\n\nAs a former evangelical protestant who converted to being a Catholic over a ton of issues, there\'s a lot of things that make me very pleased with my choice. The fact that there is a massive amount of writing and history behind the vast majority of church ideas (No, ""because, that\'s why"" which I got all the time as a protestant) and many ""rites"" or varieties of worship, all with the same essential center point in Christ.\n\nThe fact that questions and dialogue were welcomed even on divisive matters, far more than I thought they would be, and that the average priest I encountered had acceptable and even profound answers, not to mention other devoted Catholics. There was an abundance of studied belief among devout practicing Catholics, not just blind acceptance.\n\nI was pleased by the time and financial commitment to the social good so many Catholics have - a ton of devoted Catholics are in service and helping professions. The majority of us love science, rhetoric, and logic and use it in discussion, which often surprises people without a faith system who haven\'t met someone in a religious system that welcomes these things, though it\'s not as uncommon even in other religious systems as people with no religious background may have experienced. Devout Catholics take after Jewish people in their interest in discussions without easy answers.\n\nThe encouragement to care for the earth and each other and even ourselves with self-worth, and the acknowledgement that we are not naturally good.\n\nHonestly, the list is pretty long.\n\nAll of these things suited me, but above all, I do believe in the God of the Bible, and that the Bible is an anthology of works that pertain to his acts and presence in the world, and the records of people in history that can help us today - and that there are thousands more saints throughout history whose record is added to that. If it were just the Bible, that would be one thing. But the record of many who like I do today, worshipped and strived to become the human they were created to be... That\'s inspiring. The Catholicism I chose makes me strive to be better, kinder, more aware of the needs and desires of others - not just Jesus. \n\nI had Jesus before Catholicism. He made me want to be better, but I didn\'t feel like I had a great path. Catholicism gave me the path to walk on.

There\'s no reason for a game to treat male/more masculine players worse than female/more feminine players - not even if the game is hugely played by female/more feminine players. Sure, it\'s not as serious in a game like this - but treating minorities worse because ""they\'re the minority"" was never a good idea. \r\n\r\nI do however agree on the fact that they shouldn\'t make masculine clothes cheaper or more expensive than feminine clothes, just because they\'re more rare or something.

For a little backstory I‚Äôm non-binary and transitioning and I felt like my dead name (trans terminology for birth name that you don‚Äôt use anymore) was dragging behind me; so I decided that I needed to part with my dead name in order to move forward with my new name. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Here's the link to the original post as there are so many great suggestions that might be what aligns with your needs better if you're interested! \r\n\r\n<LINK>/\r\n\r\nI‚Äôm gonna talk about how I prepared first but will put a ‚Äú**‚Äù symbol where I actually talk about the ritual if that‚Äôs all you want to read. \r\n\r\nI ended up incorporating a bunch of ideas together to come up with what I ended up doing. BUT FIRST I wanted to say that I didn‚Äôt actually do any sort of ritual until about two months later, and I didn‚Äôt plan on doing the ritual the day I did it, I just woke up and I knew that I was ready. The two months before I actually did the ritual, I started going by my new name (Leo!) and came to all the supportive people in my life and asked them to use that for me including they/them pronouns. I still felt my dead name clinging to my identity, I didn‚Äôt realize it until selkigirl mentioned it, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it was dysphoria. So for me the first step was coming into my new name, creating more space for myself to really fit into the idea and essence that I really identified with in the name Leo, and slowly yet unknowingly created less space for my dead name to have a place in my life. not sure if that sentence made sense but yeah lol. \r\n\r\nI also took a recommendation from another user (can‚Äôt remember who it was but if you‚Äôre reading this THANK YOU SO SO MUCH) to write my dead name on a piece of paper and try to make it beautiful, it was kind of like exposure therapy in a way, but it helped me realize that I did have negative feelings for my dead name and also let me see it and appreciate it in a ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt my name anymore, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I have to hate you‚Äù kind of way. I meditated on how I wanted to feel when I would be called my new name, and I actually used a crystal to meditate on this with and literally two or three days later it vanished from existence, which for me means that the crystal has served its purpose. That was really encouraging for me and helped me solidify the bond I created with my new name. \r\n\r\nI won‚Äôt lie, I didn‚Äôt meditate on a regular basis, but I did when it felt right and that was enough for me. \r\n\r\n** So, to talk about the actual ritual!! It was actually really nice for me. I did this on May 22nd, which was a new/dark moon in gemini. For me gemini represents rapid change and that energy along with the dark moon energy was super strong and hopeful and I knew I was ready. First I cleansed myself with some deep breathing and a little palo santo. Then I took a white strip of cloth, long enough to tie around my wrist, and wrote my new name on it. I also took the piece of paper that had my beautified dead name on it, left the soon-to-be name tag/strip of cloth on the desk in my room, and headed outside. Since I live in a city it wasn‚Äôt pitch black or perfectly silent, but I looked into the dark-moon-sky and I FELT silent. It was really peaceful and beautiful. It felt like the entire world was in the universes womb. I listened to some Tibetan singing bowl tracks on Spotify and just meditated standing up. I imagined myself as a baby, just floating around, not having any name or label or gender forced on me, not identifying as anything other than a pure, un-stained soul. \r\n\r\nAlthough I probably should have done this before imagining myself as a unnamed being, I next took the piece of paper with my dead name on it, and started reflecting on it. Thanking it for getting me to where I am, and really really being thankful for it. I made sure to make it clear that the only thing I was releasing was the dead name, not any part of myself that it was attached to, as another person who reached out in my original post told me that their detachment from their old name was so effective they lost all their ID (thank you to you too!!!). Then I took the paper, thanked it out loud, then I burned it. I could have buried it or put it in a jar, but burning it felt like the most effective way to symbolize that it held no power over me anymore. \r\n\r\nFor me this was all I had to do to feel like I had released it, since I spent a good amount of time welcoming my new name and connecting to it, my dead name already felt insignificant and letting it go was relatively easy. \r\n\r\nAfter I went back to meditating on that feeling of not being labelled yet, I went back inside to take a bath. This was sort of suggested by someone as well, I can‚Äôt remember how much of this was their idea and how much was my own but if you suggested this thank you!!! I took a bath in the pitch dark and really put myself in that feeling of not being labelled, like an unborn baby. (Side note: I didn‚Äôt try to actually be a baby in the womb, but emulated that unlabelled feeling that Age regressing was not something that I did, but if it helps others cope then by all means go for it as long as you‚Äôre not hurting yourself or anyone else. Also idk if ‚Äúunborn baby‚Äù is tone deaf but I mean this strictly in the terms of what feeling I was trying to feel. I support reproductive rights!) \r\n\r\nAfter the bath, I went to my room, and I tied the strip of cloth with my new name on it to my wrist and said ‚ÄúI claim this name for myself. It is done‚Äù and I went to bed. I wore the bracelet for three days straight afterwards. I‚Äôm gonna bury it on the full moon if it feels right :)\r\n\r\nI mentioned dysphoria at the beginning, wanted to clarify that even though I have released my dead name, I am still being called by it every day by family. So it still created dysphoria but the difference is now I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs coming from myself, the dysphoria is coming from outer circumstances. It obviously isn‚Äôt great but I know in my heart that that is not my name anymore, it has definitely become easier to handle. I do hope my identity can be respected by my family at one point though. <BOLD> ** I‚Äôm also saying all of this for myself, what worked for me won‚Äôt work for everyone and this isn‚Äôt like the cure to dysphoria by any means!!! \r\n\r\nThank you so so much for everyone that helped, even if I didn‚Äôt use your suggestion the support alone was monumental I‚Äôve never felt so supported in my life thank you thank you thank you.

We were having dinner and my daughter (age 12) was talking about how she got accepted for a summer program with the local animal shelter, and my son said ""Pog you, easy clap"". I told him that it was getting out of hand and that he would have to communicate normally to his parents and family. To that he said ""Weird champ, feels weird man, normies omega LOL."" Until he learns to communicate like a normal human being I\'ve blacklisted Twitch from the internet for the time being.

Lately, they've all been shitting on me, because my character has different morals and ideas, and its pissing me off. Ex. Said I wasn't worth much as a party member even though I was crucial in a huge fight where at least 2 of them probably would have died. They've also been ignoring story elements in favor of shitting on me. Ex. Said we were attacked because of something I did, when the attackers said they had been told to attack us before I even did the thing. They don't even try to understand my character, they just hate her. I thought that at least the GM was cool until tonight. Basically just railroaded me several times, and pulled some bullshit concerning one of my rolls.\r\n\r\nNOW WHAT?:\r\nSo now I'm pissed af and I'm gonna read more of the books to devide world and such and try to find players to GM my own campaign on Roll20, because I KNOW it can be done better than this. People shit on GURPS a lot, but it's pretty clear once you get the hang of the basics.\r\n\r\nWhy GURPS and not DnD?

I wanted to be referred straight to dermatology and I could've been as my GP knew how much it had affected my self-esteem however my mum, who had this treat when she was my age, fed me all these horror stories about this treatment to convince me to do antibiotic treatment first.\r\n\r\nNow that those antibiotic treatments failed, I am scared about the prospect of going up against what I have been told is a vicious treatment. I need some advice from the people also going through the treatment as to what I can do to cope through the treatment plan. I'm a pretty tough guy and managed to get back to full function after being hit by a bus in a matter of a month.""]",M

Is there anyone here who experienced what I‚Äôm going through and do you have any advice? \n\nMy girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. We‚Äôve been together 6 years. I have identified as male my entire life, but have recently been questioning my gender identity. If I‚Äôm being honest, even if I didn‚Äôt realize it, it started when I hit puberty and developed a fascination for the transformation fetish. Particularly MTF transformation. I am now 24, and have begun imagining having a vagina as I masturbate, or imagining being a woman as my girlfriend and I have sex. I sometimes picture us as a lesbian couple. I find the idea of being a woman very arousing, along with the idea of wearing dresses and makeup and being told I‚Äôm pretty. I feel pretty embarrassed admitting this, even though I‚Äôm doing it anonymously. Despite that though, I don‚Äôt really experience severe gender dysphoria. Most of the time I‚Äôm perfectly happy living my life as a man and identifying as one. I find the idea of transitioning to be absolutely terrifying, and I get embarrassed when I think about being referred to by my she/her pronouns.

Although Desvenlafaxine works alright \r\n\r\nI‚Äôm a super depressed individual, in just about every sense. It‚Äôs been about 3 years since it picked up hard, and about 1 and a 1/2 years since I‚Äôve started being somewhat functional again. \r\n\r\nSo some background: I was on venlafaxine for 6 months after my previous medication, paroxetine, gave nasty side effects and didn‚Äôt work reliably. \r\n\r\nI‚Äôm going to condense/simplify this some, but here‚Äôs my explanation as to how and why it fucked me up so badly: So venlafaxine‚Äôs most active metabolite (little chemical bit that it makes) is called Desvenlafaxine, which causes the brain to think it‚Äôs making more serotonin (neurotransmitter that makes you feel ‚Äòhappiness‚Äô, etc) and norepinephrine (neurotransmitter that gives you energy) through various processes. However, in delivering it in a slightly different form it requires some enzymes in the host to do the work on changing it from Venlafaxine to that good-good Desvenlafaxine. \r\nHowever, I have this fun quirk about me where two of the enzymes partly involved in this funky transition (CYP2C9 and CYP3A4) have mutations in the genetic code that makes them. This means they‚Äôre garbage at their job, and instead the shit Venlafaxine makes does only about 50% of what it should be doing in my brain, and the other 50% goes off and causes <ITALIC> fuuuuuuuun side effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nI slept 15-20 hours a day, would be dream-like even after I woke up every morning to the point that I would turn off three alarms that required me to spin in circles to turn off and fall back asleep with no memory of the event. \r\nNot to mention the mood-swings, acne, increased overall depression and hopelessness.\r\n\r\nNo thank you kind sir, I have had my fill', ""AITA For getting away from my supportive family? (21M) \n Alright, so I love my family. They're incredibly supportive, and I'm beyond thankful to have them on my side. I have a big family, but my dad is financially stable enough that they have helped me pay for my college tuition. I'm on my last year of college, but they still provide me with money for my medicine (I have a disease that requires medication that costs 700$ a month) and in the past when I was at college without a job yet, they provided money for essentials while I was at school. I thank them almost daily for their kindness in this.\r\n\r\nTypically I'm either working away from home or at college working and studying. These past two weeks have been a bit of an in-between period. My summer job has ended, and I've been at home with my family. They recently moved, and as its a new locale for me I don't have a job in the area. I've been staying with them these past weeks doing my own thing, trying to enjoy my time off while helping out. I've been cleaning after myself and others, hanging out some with my parents, and try to play with my younger siblings for an hour to two hours a day. We also typically have dinners together daily.\r\n\r\nNow, while I love my family and am incredibly grateful, being in one place with them for the past few weeks has been hard. We've been under a lot of stress because of extended familial issues, and I feel they've been putting some of it onto me. The other day my sister (19, also home from college for the summer w/o a job) was trying to express how the summer has been hard for her due to her lack of ability to attend therapy. She did this by saying this hasn't been a good summer for her. My parents began yelling at her for this, telling her it isn't fair for her to complain when they've provided this much for her. When I stepped in to say that it was about her mental health and not about their actions towards her, they began to berate me as well. They said that I never want to be around them, never help them, am ungrateful, and don't think outside of myself.\r\n\r\nOne of the key facets of their argument was that daily my sister and I have been going to coffee out of the house daily or sleeping in. They called this laziness and trying to escape from them, and were deeply hurt. They don't see why we would want to get out of the house for a bit if they are supportive and loving, and while they allow us to go to coffee are continually offended when we tell them we are stepping out for a bit to this day. I still try to clean the house and do every task they ask me or mention to me without complaint, along with telling them daily I love them and am thankful for their providence. I don't hate them and try my best, but sometimes I just need a break from my family in the form of stepping out for a few hours.\r\n\r\nI don't want to be ungrateful. I understand that they do provide a lot for me.\r\n\r\nAITA here for wanting to get out for a bit or spending some time alone in my room each day?""]",M

If you‚Äôre at a spot it sounds like your BIL is, it‚Äôs immensely frustrating. You know something is wrong, that your brain isn‚Äôt right, but you have no way of fixing it.

Many severely mentally impaired people that lash out do so because they want love and connection, but don‚Äôt know how to find it within the outside world. OP, your current actions are completely justified, but please remain open to a future connection with your BIL after time passes. \r\n\r\nAnd for people in comments who say they have a mental impairment and that doesn‚Äôt excuse BIL behaviors, please consider that you don‚Äôt know the gravity of his disability. I know how hard having disabilities can be, and also don‚Äôt excuse these types of behaviors in people that share my disabilities at a lower or equal level of severity.

My husband has a huge family, and they will be essentially the only people there. Aside from my sister, I have no family. I cut my parents off during my pregnancy for the sake of my son and myself, and while it was the best choice for my family, it absolutely hurts. My parents are both diagnosed bipolar, and alcoholics and were incredibly abusive towards me and my siblings our entire childhood. I didn't realize how dysfunctional my childhood was until I moved out. I allowed my parents to remain a part of my life up until my pregnancy, when both my parents had mental breakdowns, and said some really horrible things about myself, my partner, and my son. Anyway, this party planning is making me painfully aware of the fact that I have no one. I know it's not my fault, but for some reason I feel embarrassed and ashamed that no one from my family will ever attend an event like this.

No childcare, or anything, they just see each other daily. He\'s also the only grandparent my son has. \r\n\r\nI came about as nonbinary a few months ago, but only came out to my FIL a few days ago.

I don\'t like him very much, but I keep the peace for my husband\'s sake and my son. We\'re trying very hard to find our own place.\r\n\r\n Anyway, when I came out I was fully expecting him to make fun of me, tell me I\'m weird or something mildly insulting. I was very wrong. The first thing out of his mouth was ""I\'m the type that I don\'t care what color you are, what you say you are, if you\'re gay, or not but you will not get me to call you what you want to be called."" He went on to say that my asking him to use they/them pronouns was stepping on his rights to say what he wants to say. He also said that because of his age he couldn\'t possibly learn how to do this.

If you have a ""deep conversation"" kind of relationship with her or it\'s important to you to understand each other, you might unpack that. Why does it bother her so much? Does she see it as a reflection of her parenting? Does she understand this is an expression of your identity & what makes you content, & that her parenting shaped you into a person who chooses to be who she is?\r\n\r\nAnyway, totally agree with <USER>. You\'re gay/bi all the time, it\'s part of your identity, & you don\'t need any further validation except knowing yourself, though it feels good. I had a similar track: LTR with guy, short period of questioning bi vs. gay. I was pretty sure, final step was that first girl kiss in 5 years & it was done: ""wtf was I thinking, I never want to do <ITALIC> anything but this, definitely 1000% gay"". I\'m not sure having a gf would help you solidify the gay label since you\'re already fine with bi, but rather thinking about men (men you meet, see, or have dated/fucked) & thinking ""would I like to be involved with them in any physical way? would I enjoy it?"" Really dig into your own desires & try to separate out the thoughts & compulsions that come from socialization, media, pressure, history. I realize I\'m focusing on physical stuff there, & while there\'s much more to a relationship, I really think that\'s the line between friends & romantic relationships. I\'ve had closer emotional relationships with platonic friends or hookups than some people I\'ve dated.\r\n\r\nIn regards to coming out to family, I was on that same fence. Then I read something about how, if you don\'t expect positive acceptance or they are conservative (mine are), they will have trouble making sense of it, so waiting until you have a gf could cause them to assign blame to her for ""turning you gay"", ""corrupting you"", ""pressuring you"", miscellaneous other bullshit. So I decided for me it was important to show them this is who I am regardless of anyone else\'s influences or involvement. And them being in very conservative christian communities, I wanted to be the one to start the ripple. You know how they say when a person knows someone who is gay, they are more likely to move in an accepting direction & spread that to their network. For you, I would get to a little more comfortable level with your current place on the spectrum before making any moves (don\'t wait for 100%), because it will affect what you say. And you want to be confident in what you say, stumbling leads to them assuming ""phase"".

The lyrics of the track acts as a criticism of consumerist culture, with Trimm Trabbs being the name of a popular type of sneakers manufactured by Adidas. The narrator of the song states that despite having the same footwear as ‚Äúthe flash boys‚Äù, he still feels empty and alone. The address said at the start of the song is apparently for a hotel in West Hollywood, and was presumably a hotel the band stayed at while on tour.\r\n\r\nMusically the song starts off somewhat strangely, with a quick piano riff followed by some Yoko Ono-esque vocal inflections by Damon, before settling in to a steady pace with Damon‚Äôs vocals backed by some guitar and a nice drum beat by Dave. Many have remarked that the song‚Äôs chord progression bears a close resemblance to the song Wined and Dined by Syd Barrett, who Blur have stated are one of their biggest influences. Around the 3 minute mark the song changes dramatically however, as it explodes from the blocks thanks to some heavy guitar playing from Graham, with the outro containing some chaotic playing from Graham and muffled screaming from Damon.\r\n\r\nLyrical highlight: ‚ÄúI've got trimm trabb, Like the flash boys have‚Äù\r\n\r\nMusical highlight: Guitar work, drumming, piano riff\r\n\r\nBest performers: Damon, Graham, Dave\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>""]",M

I said obviously I can't book it now, so how do I?

This would be my first formal project management job title, and I am trying to pin down what is appropriate to ask for in salary negotiations given the circumstances. I have no problem with being assertive if I am well informed, and I know I am the right candidate for the position, but as a mid-twenties female negotiating with an EVP who also knows my current job title and salary is basically that of an unofficial office manager, I want to have a solid understanding of what is fair to the market, and google research seems wildly all over the place.\n\nDetails:\n\nThe PM role is overseeing migration of our old flagship product to our new flagship product. I have experience working with PM and BPM in a leadership role at one of the Big Five tech giants in my last position, which included handling of onboarding and end-of-life service for multiple SaaS products, which is directly applicable. \n\nI have 18 months of established expertise and relationships at this company working directly with both our old and new products, our IT teams, and our clients in the field. No one else in the company has this hands-on experience with both. I have glowing reviews from both teams. \n\nBecause I have worked with both I know that both teams are frustrated, the migration is going poorly, and both IT and the field feel that leadership is not listening to complaints about flaws with the new product because they have already sunk so many millions into this new product. This product line is the only profitable arm of the company this year so far, and instability with the new product risks losing some of our biggest clients. This makes the political situation of the position very tense and high profile.\n\nI do not have a PMP as I have not been able to get the formal hours to qualify yet. I do not have a degree in IT or Tech, just a history with translating engineers to higher leadership and field reps. I accepted my current position at $50K, which was higher than advertised but I was able to negotiate due to a competing offer to return to the big five for another contract at a higher rate. I‚Äôve since received a raise putting me at $52K now, which is still less than I received at the Big Five.\n\nI am hoping to wait for an offer from the EVP before beginning negotiations, but I have no idea what is fair given my combo of unique skill sets and experience. I am hoping to set a minimum of $80K to accept, given the scope and profile of the project, but higher averages on this form of PM position online seem to range from $90k-$120k. \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.', ""I really do want to leave my contracting company, but in the Seattle area where I work they pretty much dominate the workforce if you don't have 10 plus years of experience in your field."", ""At a BDSM party at a sex club/community center.

Although I am non-binary, I am not a trans woman specifically, so I could really use some help with her portrayal and coming out, specifically. \r\n\r\nContext: two other (cis male) main characters are in a coffee shop when they spot the trans woman character, Victoria. The two other characters are trying to get in touch with a long lost friend who basically disappeared off the face of the earth and all social media, so contacting him via traditional means is off the table. They see Victoria, notice the resemblance, and wonder if perhaps he had a sister. They call her over and ask if she knows their friend, and she basically has to tell them that she does‚Äôt just know him, she <ITALIC> was him at one point. Her friends are totally accepting and chill, of course, because who tf wants transphobia in their feel-good play?\r\n\r\nAlthough a pretty minor plot point, I included Victoria‚Äôs transition to symbolize how the main cast have changed and evolved over the years of knowing each other, and to criticize the hypermasculinity of the industry in which they all met. Victoria is secure in her gender, however as a person/character she‚Äôs rather soft-spoken, almost shy. That‚Äôs one of the reasons why I‚Äôm having such a hard time writing her coming-out dialogue with the other two characters - she is shocked to stumble upon her old friends and afraid they might not accept her for who she is, but she‚Äôs still not ashamed of herself.

Quite the contrary actually; I‚Äôm a sword wielder in any game I play that has them. And the bigger the sword, the cooler I tend to think they are. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, Swords in D2 appear to be in a rather awkward situation. They don‚Äôt provide the efficacy against bosses that other heavies do (not talking about exploiting ammo-less Swords) and are pretty trash in PvP against most competent players (definitely lacking in comparison to rockets). \r\n\r\nSo why don‚Äôt we change what role Swords are supposed to fill?\r\n\r\nI propose that Swords:\r\n\r\n- No longer require ammo. \r\n- Kill Guardians in 2 Swings. And nerf the tracking they have to be comparable to regular melee. (If you wanted to get creative, maybe sword hits to the back could 1  shot like melee hits in Halo did). \r\n- Benefit from melee related passives (such as striker or arcstrider trees) for PvE. But they only benefit from range/speed perks in PvP (to prevent them from becoming OHK monsters). \r\n- Go from 3rd person to 1st person (never made sense to me why they need to be 3rd person and encourage cancerous corner camping in PvP). \r\n- No longer occupy a heavy slot. \r\n\r\nThis would allow Swords to be a fun alternative to gunplay without micromanaging ammo in both PvP and PvE and without breaking the game balance. \r\n\r\nShotguns/snipers/rockets would all trump in PvP, but in PvE Swords could be useful for add clearing or even do potential big damage with a proper setup (but still put players at risk).', 'New to the Community and figured I‚Äôd post this here.

It isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a bit of a twisting of the wires, a different way the person who has it perceives and expresses information. Some are nonverbal, some are very eloquent. Some have trouble with social or societal cues and some don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a spectrum. \r\n\r\nAutism Speaks sees this condition, this state of mind that is not lethal and is not physically painful, and they see it as a detriment to the people who have to raise the children. They see it as something that is a curse, a horrible affront to all decency. They want to get rid of autism, not assist people who have it or support parents who have autistic kids. \r\n\r\nAutism isn‚Äôt exactly a blessing, but it isn‚Äôt a curse either. The curse is people who treat you like subhuman for being born different, for thinking and acting in ways that aren‚Äôt neurotypical but harm no one. I wouldn‚Äôt want to be born any other way, but according to this organization I should feel ashamed and horrified at my own existence. \r\n\r\nI am not broken, nor is anyone else with autism.

Wanting to remove us from existing is a bullshit way of saying you don‚Äôt like how we‚Äôre different so you want us gone. \r\n\r\nCancer kills people. Diabetes ruins lives.

Aces1312,"['I 100% relate to the ‚Äúinstinct‚Äù part. I never thought about sex, I hated tampons (only used them when I had to which happened a lot since I was a lifeguard), and NEVER thought about masturbating until my last ex told me I should. He was sexually and emotionally abusive and manipulative so that‚Äôs a whole other story. I realized, as you mentioned, the desire to jack off last year. I had never thought of it before because I had no interest in anything concerning sex/genitals. Once I realized that though, that‚Äôs when I started to question. I have always been very detached from my parts and had for years assumed my disconnect and disinterest was asexuality, now I‚Äôm questioning that again. \r\n\r\nAs to the ‚Äúrepression‚Äù, I‚Äôm 22 now and only came to realize I was trans about 8 months ago. Growing up I was an extreme tomboy, except I had LONG hair (like to my thighs). I didn‚Äôt usually get confused as a boy in person but my name is neutral so I often did online and what not. I secretly liked it but would often feel bad about liking it so I would act like it was a joke or act offended. I went through a girly phase, but not like super girly. No dresses or makeup but some girlier clothes and nails. I also went through puberty very early (I think I was second in my grade, after my sister) and pretty much immediately I hated it. I was ecstatic after my first period because it lasted 3 days and then didn‚Äôt come again for 4 months. I hated being told I had to go hang with the girls, or be more ladylike, or do my hair/nails because others would be jealous and it was so pretty. I tried to fit in with girls a little more in high school only because I would get yelled at so much for being so boyish, and I was trying to fit in and be who my parents expected me to be. I definitely had some times were I felt ashamed of liking the way people called me sir in emails, or being boyish, especially when I was told that I had qualities other girls would kill for. \r\n\r\nNow I have to figure out how to come out.', 'I just turned 22 this past week and just started realizing it. I never considered gender in anyway at all growing up. I was a tomboy through and through growing up, all my friends were guys, I hated doing my nails or hair and I refused to wear ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù clothes. Found myself reinventing myself every time I moved (about 7 times) but usually always staying more androgynous. I did have long hair, I didn‚Äôt like shoulder length and was afraid to go shorter. My stepmom came into the picture and wanted me to be more feminine so I was (barely) and hated it. I cried when I got my first period and always tried to pretend I wasn‚Äôt really getting it. Tried to avoid wearing bras (other than sport) until my mom wouldn‚Äôt let me anymore in high school. I would pretend being a boy in my room, but stopped when I realized that probably wasn‚Äôt normal and repressed it until recently. Wore a lot of baggy clothes to hide my body. Eventually went through a phase of trying to get the perfect female form (never did and it‚Äôs ok). I got a boyfriend because I thought I needed to and I quickly realized he wanted a lot more than I did and I was very uncomfortable. But he made me feel I had to do things as a girlfriend (later I‚Äôd realize how shitty he was). We broke up and I went back to my baggy clothes. I‚Äôve never dated anyone since. In college I stayed comfortable in my baggy clothes, joined an athletics team and became more sporty. Loved wearing suits for work. I dyed my hair purple, came out as aroace (may be because I can‚Äôt imagine myself with anyone as a female and don‚Äôt feel any attraction as I am now). Now I‚Äôm in grad school and living alone and been exploring myself more. Realized if I think of having sex I don‚Äôt want it as a girl, but want a penis. Realized I hated my chest and felt euphoric when I could get it mostly flat. Started telling my friends I was questioning and just felt right. Bought a bunch of men‚Äôs clothes and felt more comfortable than ever. Finally, yesterday I cut my hair off (all of it, it‚Äôs nearly buzzed on the sides and longer on top) and everyone noticed how much happier and more comfortable I immediately felt in my own skin. \r\n\r\nSorry this was long.', 'This is how I have felt my entire life but I had never realized it was dysphoria until last year.

How I see it is that now, this child who will likely identify with their agab is now being forced to use pronouns that may not fit them. Yes this gives them the freedom to decide, but I fear a child cannot understand completely. They cannot consent to this. They do not get the choice. Which is why I feel it's better to let them choose later, after they already know themselves. It's how I found myself. I know that, had I been raised using they/them pronouns, I would have had a happier childhood. But is my child, who likely wont want to use they/them pronouns, going to suffer how I did?

I'm questioning mtf, and I realized something the other day.\n\nI'm 5'5, and every day of my life I hated being so short as a guy because I felt lesser in a way, or that I wouldn't be taken as seriously, or just uncomfortable that I was so much shorter than my male peers.\n\nOnce I stared seriously considering transition, though, I stopped hating it. I actually kind of like being so short because It fits my image of what I want to look like as a woman better. \n\nSo my question is this: If I was <ITALIC> really trans, wouldn't I have always liked being so short? Is this something other people have experienced, or is it not normal? Thanks!"", 'Thinking about transitioning, but no dysohoria \n This is kind of uncomfortable for me to post because I feel like I\'m stuck at a crossroads between transitional to female and maybe being happier, and staying as male and maybe getting over it in the future.\n\nI want to get right into it. I don\'t feel dysphoria, atleast not how I\'ve seen it described. I recognize that right now, I am male, my body is male, and my brain is male. This isn\'t a pot shot at people who think otherwise that have/are/will be transitioning: it just has nothing to do with me.\n\nThe reason I want to transition, or why I think I do anyway, is because I think I\'d be happier as a girl. For the past couple years whenever I saw a woman acting in a feminine way, even just the way they stand or look around, I get jealous. I realized I wanted to stand the way they do, to laugh and look and act like a woman. In those past couple years, I\'ve given up on being a masculine guysy guy because I figured I was just more effeminate than typical. Most of my friends are woman, I like cute things, etc, but I\'m still jealous. I want to have long hair and stand in cute ways.\n\nI know I keep coming back to the standing thing, and I know it\'s a small detail, but it\'s what made me initially realize I was interested in becoming a female, so I just keep coming back to it.\n\nBut I really don\'t think I\'m dysphoric. I don\'t think I\'m a woman trapped in a man\'s body. Again I have absolutely no problem if you do feel dysphoric in this way, it\'s just not what I feel about myself. I recognize that right now, I\'m a guy, but I think I\'d like to be a girl. It\'s a shame there\'s no trial or demo, haha.\n\nI\'ve thought about cross dressing before, because I think that\'s as close to a ""demo"" that I could get, but when I think of myself wearing the makeup and the clothes and a wig and staring into the mirror I don\'t think I\'ll like it. It feels wrong, but I\'m not really sure why I guess. I think it\'s because I still identify as a male, and so I don\'t want to see my male self dressed like a girl. (as an aside, I don\'t like seeing myself at all, but I think that\'s more of a self image problem)\n\nIve spent the last couple days looking at both <SUBREDDIT> and <SUBREDDIT>, because I like seeing both sides of it, and it honestly scares me. I understand that one sub is full of people who have had/are having happy experiences transitioning, and the other is full of people who are regretful, but its making me very nervous. Will I really be happy as a girl? Will I be OK with taking pills for the rest of my life? From stories on detrans I\'ve kinda decided against ever getting surgery, and I think I\'m kind of OK with that, if a bit let down.\n\n I really just wish I was born a girl. I wish I had my childhood as a girl, grown up as a girl, gone to high school as a girl, etc. Although I guess a lot of people want that, haha.\n\nI\'m any case I\'d really appreciate any insight on my situation, whether you\'re trans or not, supportive or not. I dont really feel comfortable talking about this to people I know irl, but I really really just want to talk to <ITALIC> someone about it. Thank you, and I\'m sorry of any of my comments felt offensive. I just want to say again that everything Ive said is about me, and I have absolutely nothing against the detrans or trans communities or people who have / have had gender dysphoria.\n\nTLDR: Not sure if I\'m dysphoric and I\'m scared of making the commitment.

On my second event I got to be a paladin for mostly the entire weekend!\r\n(and I also discovered that where LARPing is concerned, I am far less careful than I normally am! Something wich slightly shocked and scared my boyfriend at the time; as he'd hoped to gently ease me into it).\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that I am a little more familiar with the setting of my LARP and with the hobby (lifestyle?) as a whole, I decided it was time I experienced the other side of it as a player.\r\nFor the next two events, I'll still be an NPC, but after that I want to be my own character. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow, I've written some stories in my day and I've created some costumes for renfaires (or whatever my local equivalent of those are); but doing these things for LARP is something on an entirely different level! (As in I will actually have to BE this character, maybe for a couple of years if I'm lucky).\r\nI have some idea where to start, but I could really use some advice of more experienced LARPers!\r\nLike what are some definite don'ts when creating a first character? Are there certain things I should avoid (especially seeing as I'm not entirely great at improv-acting yet)?\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you guys have any tips in the costuming department? I have several months to create this costume (and I have some fabrics that I think will do nicely), so time is not a problem.\r\nIs there anything I should or shouldn't do as far as my costume is concerned? \r\nI've only ever created costumes that I only had to wear for a couple of hours, so if they weren't entirely comfortable that wasn't really a problem...\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, are there some general hints, tips or tricks that I might not be aware of?

And for all for all of this - exactly how often should I be doing this?  I know it\'s going to vary person to person but I just don\'t even know where to start!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n<BOLD> -------  The Background Post -------    (read this for more detailed information)\r\n\r\nI\'m 30 years old and until now didn\'t really put any effort into my skin.  I have mild dermatillomania which I tend to focus on my fingers and chest rather than my face (fortunately?) but it will migrate when I start getting pimples and such.  While I know hot showers are bad for my skin they\'re one of the few things I have that seem to calm a host of other issues and allow me to relax and get a reasonable night\'s sleep.  (I tried going cooler back when my hair was colored but while my color lasted longer, I got less sleep and my anxiety/stress skyrocketed). Because I have curly hair and oily scalp, I wash my hair about once every 4-6 days depending on how my hair is feeling.  I use a dry shampoo usually once within that period if my hair seems greasy but my forehead acne and hair/scalp health has majorly improved since switching to this routine two years ago. \r\n\r\nSO, hot showers dry out skin.  I then have oily skin (probably due to an overproduction of oils to counteract the dry skin from the showers).  I started using <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> in the mornings but my face seemed to just get worse and my breakouts and clogged pores were terrible.  When I stopped, it seemed to fade.  However, I hate how dry and stretched my skin feels despite also leaking oil.  It\'s gross and my pores are clogged anyway.  I do break out badly whenever I start my period as well.\r\n\r\nI know staying hydrated is important and I\'m not a huge fan of water but drink about 64-130oz of tea a day.  The tea is whole loose leaf tea brewed in low temp water with no additives (it\'s very high quality tea, brewed gongfu style usually, and at a lower temperature \\~160-170F so by time I drink it it\'s usually around or below 120F).\r\n\r\nI rock climb and do a variety of classes (ROM, CoreFit, Yoga, Swimming (less often)) and do drink just water during those, usually going through about 32 oz of pure water.\r\n\r\nI am """"""""dieting"""""" and by that I mean, eating healthy and just trying to lose weight.  I am not following any specific diet plan but most of my diet is based on Japanese style cooking with Mediterranean and Eastern Asian cuisine thrown in.  Lots of seafood (usually salmon and shrimp), chicken (moving away from thigh to breast) and veggies (broc, sweet potato, kabocha, cauliflower, leafy greens (kale, spinach, collards), carrots, etc).  I portion out my rice as well when I make it in bulk so I usually end up with about 4oz in a serving.  My main goal is to stay under right around 1200 calories per day.  I eat when I am hungry and stop when I\'m full and it generally seems to work out.  I do eat sweets but only occasionally.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I do not wear makeup much (beyond some crappy concealer when blemishes are really bad and I have an event at work).  \r\n\r\nI sleep on a silk pillowcase (curly hair works better with it) and I know I should wash it more frequently.  I just got a second one and while I was going about 2 weeks between washings but I would like to get to it 1x a week at least now!  It\'s only been about a month since this changed but I\'m not sure I\'m seeing any skin changes at this point.  As for sleep habits, I get about 6-7 hours of sleep a night - I try to get in bed by 11:00pm each night and be attempting to sleep at 11:30pm.  I wake up at 5:45/6:00am.  Sometimes if I\'m lucky I can get in bed by 10 but that\'s rare.  \r\n\r\nLastly, I\'m afab (assigned female at birth) but ID as nonbinary.  I am looking to start on low dose testosterone and I suspect that\'s going to mess up my skin (it\'s basically second puberty).  I may have to alter whatever routine I start now but I figured it\'s better to get into good habits now than put it off.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\\-------\r\n\r\n<BOLD> I\'ll try and sum all that up as best I can\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  30 years old\r\n AFAB (not yet on horomones but looking to start testosterone within the year)\r\n* Dry skin that produces a LOT of oil to make up for it \r\n   <ITALIC>  HOT SHOWERS \r\n 6-7 hrs sleep per night / silk pillowcase washed 1x a week\r\n* Decent hydration \r\n   <ITALIC>  Mostly tea though, which counteracts some of that\r\n No makeup on a day-to-day basis\r\n* Healthy foods and regular exercise\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n<BOLD> IF YOU MADE IT THIS FAR BLESS YOUR SOUL and thank you so much!

Aces1312,"['Hoping someone can relate. Trying to work through some stuff. \n So in September I admitted to myself for the first time that I might be transgender (FTM) and I still mostly feel like that is correct. In October I came out to my closest friends, who have all been nothing but supportive, and right after my 22nd birthday I cut off all my hair for the first time in my life. I nearly cried I was so happy. I switched my pronouns in November with and got my first binder. I had been in therapy already and saw a dramatic decrease in my depression following these changes (like from suicidal to nearly nothing). Sure the depression still fluctuates heavily, especially now that I‚Äôm home again where I‚Äôm a ‚Äúpart time boy‚Äù as my friend and I call it since I‚Äôm not yet out to my family. \r\n\r\nI know I feel best when binding, with short hair, and in men‚Äôs clothes, and I know that I can‚Äôt help but smile when I hear ‚Äúhe‚Äù or ‚Äúsir‚Äù used for me, but I also have days where I doubt everything and think that I‚Äôm just pretending because I‚Äôm unhappy with my body. I try to convince myself on these days that if that were true my friends wouldn‚Äôt be pointing out my increased confidence in how I look, my decreased instances of self harm, or the fact that I haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about coming out since I said it to myself nearly 9 months ago. I have a new therapist now who helps me with this, and was able to tell me I fit the description of gender dysphoria, but I still find myself thinking that I am lying to him, to myself, to my friends. I think a big part is anxiety. And more is the feeling that I can‚Äôt be trans because I didn‚Äôt know until now (I know plenty of people don‚Äôt), because I did have long hair and painted my nails (though I think that was a show off thing because it was nail art). Some days I feel ok with my body, but I recognize those days I‚Äôm usually binding and in clothes I like. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and don‚Äôt feel dysphoria and feel fake. Sometimes I still dream that I am a woman, or don‚Äôt feel as upset hearing ‚Äúshe/her‚Äù from family, but still get upset hearing it from strangers. \r\n\r\nI know these things don‚Äôt really matter, my heart knows that. My heart knows the misery I felt/feel in my body, the fact that I‚Äôve never felt like I belonged with the girls, the overwhelming disgust I felt when having to shop for bras, the fear and discomfort of getting a period, the secret wish for breast cancer to chop off my chest, the hidden fantasy of being a boy that was suppressed for years.

What if not seeing yourself in the mirror is better than what you‚Äôll see if you transition?‚Äù It would be so much easier to just stay ‚Äúfemale‚Äù.

I\'m going to go chronologically, hopefully that\'ll help keep it all together.\n\nFor reference, my mom and dad have been divorced since I was a baby.\n\nWhen I was a kid (probably starting around 5-6 if I had to put a number on it) I used to love having my sister dress me up in princess dresses, and playing Barbies with her. I remember having this one dream as a kid where I went out into the backyard and there was a fairy/angel that offered to grant me a wish, and my wish was to become a girl. I continued to wear my sister\'s pajamas and whatnot every once in a while for the next few years. When I was around 11, I started staying up until everyone at my dad\'s house was asleep, and then grabbing a pair of panties and wearing them for a little while. I also found a couple transgender YouTubers (Princess Jules was my favorite) and watching videos about MtF surgery. After a week or so of getting away with wearing the panties in the middle of the night, I got a bit more bold and I started wearing my sister\'s dresses and even tried lip gloss. After a few days of doing this, my dad caught on. He waited for me to leave the room when I thought everyone was asleep, then once I had grabbed a dress and went to the bathroom to put it on, he sneaked into my sister\'s room (she wasn\'t in there) and waited for me to come back in. He caught me with the dress on, and basically said ""you aren\'t gay, why are you dressing in your sister\'s clothes?""\n\nAbout a week after this, we end up getting in an argument over something, I don\'t remember what, and it ends in him disowning me, ostensibly for crossdressing, or at least that\'s what he told my Mom.\n\nFor the next few years, until I was about 15, I completely stopped crossdressing. I was the most depressed I\'ve ever been, though I don\'t really think it had so much to do with the crossdressing as how much shit happened to me around that time. When I was 15/16, I started crossdressing again, being more careful this time than before. Again, I borrowed my sister\'s clothes. This time, I started with a pair of panties.\n\n<BOLD-ITALIC> (NSFW)\n\nAfter the pair of panties, I borrowed a one-piece swimsuit, and while I was laying on the bathroom floor (couldn\'t go to my room for some reason) I ended up masturbating in the swimsuit. This was my first time masturbating.\n\nI think this is where things got really confusing for me. I ended up only really being into anything sexual when I was in female clothing. I found the Sissy fetish, and it seemed to fit the bill pretty well. When I was 17, I finally got a girlfriend (had had some before, but nothing serious.) She was who I lost my virginity to. A few times, I tried to get her to dress me up, only once successfully doing it by having her \'dare\' me to try on a dress in the mall\'s dressing room. I also wore some cat ears and a little choker she had got, and wore one of her thongs once (she wasn\'t a fan of that.)\n\nHer and I ended up breaking it off, and a few days later I started dating my now-fiancee. I told her about my \'fetish\' up-front, and she was into it. After the first couple times, every time we had sex it was me being submissive and female. About a year and a half into our relationship, we ended up breaking up, and I went to a friend\'s house who I had confided in about my female side, and she took me to a party while I was crossdressed; it took so long to get my makeup done though that by the time we got there it was over. We ended up sitting there talking to the party host\'s wife (the host was a transgender woman herself) about random shit, and playing Cards Against Humanity while drinking tequila. She offered to refer to me as a girl if I preferred, but I told her that it didn\'t matter to me, because I wasn\'t really sure what I was myself. That night wasn\'t sexual for me, as I thought dressing up was always going to be, and that\'s where I started to have questions as to who I really was again.\n\n<BOLD-ITALIC> (End NSFW)\n\nFast forward, and my girlfriend and I are back together. I tell her that maybe this isn\'t all sexual, and she\'s again supportive. We\'re not able to really explore anything, so the extent of crossdressing I did was sexual still. About a month ago though, we moved into our own apartment. \n\nThe first week for me consisted of dressing up in female clothing basically whenever I had the chance. It felt good, and it wasn\'t all sexual, so I just kept going with it. About two weeks ago, I start realizing that there\'s certain parts of my body I really don\'t like. I don\'t like having hair on my body, I don\'t like when I can see a bulge from my penis, I don\'t like having acne or a distinctly male face, I don\'t like how when I gain weight it goes to my stomach, because it screws with my otherwise feminine figure. These feelings are normally really minor, maybe not even there sometimes, but when I\'m dressed up, all of them hit me. I feel like an impostor when I\'m dressed up, and sometimes it almost makes me not want to do it at all.\n\nThe most confusing part for me is that I don\'t really hate being a male, at least I don\'t think so. For work, I\'m dressed business casual every day and every once in a while I\'ll think that I look good. I love working on my car, and I don\'t mind people referring to me as male.\n\nI wonder if I have gender dysphoria or not, or if I\'m transgender or if this is just some weird other side of me. I think that if I had the opportunity to snap my fingers and never be a male in the first place, I\'d do it. But on the other hand, if I had the opportunity to not have these feelings of being something other than male, that if I could snap my fingers and none of this shit ever happened, I\'d do that too. There\'s so much going on in my head, and it\'s impossible to put it all down in a Reddit post. Hell, I don\'t even know if I know what all is going on up there.\n\n\n\n\n<BOLD> TL;DR  \nI have been crossdressing on and off as far back as I can remember. My dad disowned me for it, and I backed off for a little bit. When I started doing it again, I thought it was a fetish. Now that I have my own apartment and I can explore, I\'ve been dressing up more and it\'s not really sexual for me anymore. I don\'t hate my body when I\'m dressed as a male (i do have a feminine figure and no body hair due to shaving for what it\'s worth), but I really start to dislike my body and voice when I\'m dressed as a female.']",F

The evening before these events, we ended up in a town in a winter-wonder-land, that requested help to defeat a Manticore. Upon hearing that we are the adventures they waited for, our bard arranged for us to get the best rooms in the inn for free, which includes a bathroom for each room with a hot tub. The only passage to this winter-wonder-land was through a magical cave, that caused us to roll on the wild magic table (Sorcerer), and our Paladin befriended a weasel that lived so long in that cave, that it now causes us to roll on the wild magic table whenever it spits at someone. It doesn\'t like our Sorcerer (you guessed it, Wild Magic), and the feeling is mutual.\n\nThe characters of this Mini-Session are Jovi, a Cleric who loves to attack and casts fire spells, Kieri, the Sorcerer, and Rook, a Cleric that only heals and doesn\'t attack.\n\nWe just finished our quest to kill the Manticore and went back to town, where we were celebrated as heroes. After a few emotional moments, we ended up in the bar of the inn where we started a drinking contest with another group of adventures. Jovi started, failed all three constitution checks in a row, and passed out. Rook was up next, despite not drinking often, she completely drank the second guy under the table with succeeding all 3 checks in a row. When she starts drinking against the third guy though, she crit fails and gets two strikes. She tags with Kieri who finishes the drinking game with only getting one strike. In a drunken state, Jovi named us the ""Future Fabulous"", and we\'re now celebrated in the bar as drinking heroes as well (and a bit richer!)\n\nWe head up to our room. Since Kieri and Rook already shared a room, they just took Jovi with in their room, as she had just arrived in the town and didn\'t had her own room yet. Kieri mentions the Hot Tub, so the group quickly gets naked (we\'re a trio of girls) and celebrates in the Hot Tub! Kieri goes and steals some more alcohol, and drinks heavily, so in the end, we\'re all super drunk. Drunk enough that Jovi (a Changeling) and Rook (a Doppelganger) start to change their appearances out of joy.\n\nWe get out of the Hot Tub and into the bedroom. Kieri, sad that she can\'t change like Jovi and Rook, uses her Disguise Self to change herself into our Monk and imitates her - punching a dent into the wall of the room. This is when things go south...\n\nThe Weasel appears, spits on Kieri. She failes her Wild Magic Roll (Disadvantage due to being drunk) and gets 10 years younger. The Weasel also spits at Jovi, who also fails her Roll, and casts Fog Cloud - the entire room gets foggy. Kieri already started to cast Magic Missle on the Weasel - thanks to the Fog Cloud we never learned if it hit or missed. It also set of her Wild Surge AGAIN and caused her to gain a third eye on her forehead.\n\nJovi starts to panic in the cloud - the cloud now takes shape of bread-shaped clouds (she\'s a bread fanatic). Kieri (in her drunken mind), casts Snilloc\'s Snowball Swarm in an attempt to get rid of the fog. Everything is consumed in snowballs, we all take damage. Jovi, now panicked AND cold, casts her Fire Bread Missles (a Homebrew fire-version of Magic Missles) against a wall of the inn. The Inn catches on fire.\n\nKieri tries to cast Snilloc\'s Snowball Swarm again to extinguish the fire. Rook (drunken as she is), first tries to cast Calm Emotions (which doesn\'t work, since she has no spell slots left) and then runs to the Hot Tub, scoops a handful of water, runs to the fire, tries to extinguish it, and runs back to the Hot Tub. All attempts to get the fire under control fail. We flee the Inn. The owner of the Inn shouts at us while the Inn burns down. Jovi has a crisis. Kieri has a crisis. Rook tries to extinguish the fire by throwing snowballs at it. Finally, Rook falls to her knees, prays to her god, Freyr, to calm everyone down. He comes and calms everyone down. She then tries to console Kieri, while Jovi picks a soup out of her pocket and tries to cook it over the fire of the Inn.\n\nKieri cries out that it\'s all her fault. Rook tries to talk her out of that mind. Kieri\'s Wild Magic sets off again - and she causes everyone Necrotic Damage, that heals her. And when I say everyone, I mean EVERYONE - the whole town was collected at the inn. At least she\'s back to full health now, but her crisis gets deeper - and the Mayor officially bans us from the town. Jovi got her soup burned up.\n\nRook prays to Freyr again to make everything ok - he doesn\'t answer her prayer this time. Exodus, Kieri\'s god, appears, tips on Kieri\'s forehead and sets her to sleep. He asks Rook to watch her better. Rook asks him to fix everything. Exodus sights and turns back time.\n\nThe inn is back. Everyone is fine. We just entered the room after our victory and fall asleep. We wake up though, with a strange nightmare of a burning in....\n\n\n\n\nLesson of the story - never, NEVER, get a group of chaotic characters get drunk all at once, or they go and burn the world down - even though they totally didn\'t meant to.', ""Couldn't you wear water proof gloves while stitching in that case?"", ""I buy my fabric from <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> \n\nThey have fabric in all kinds of colors, including hand-dye effects.

It\'s a refurbished 17"" HP Pavillion. I\'ve stuck in an SSD and more RAM. She\'s happy with it, but it keeps having glitches that she makes me fix. the battery\'s not in great shape. I got a refurbed Nitro 5 gaming laptop 6 months ago for $509 and it\'s great. I asked her if I could just get a newer one, then give her the one I currently have. She got so pissed! I figured I should ask you guys for a recommendation. Thanks.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Update i had her go over some options you guys gave me. Thanks. She isn\'t really particular about performance, she is more set on a 17"" laptop, she likes having a large monitor. There are 17"" ones out there. I asked her if she would be OK with a 17"" gaming laptop like the one I have (nitro 5 refurbed are really cheap! (at least they are most of the time, prices are really high right now for some reason, so we would wanna wait it out, like $500 for an i5 system with a 1050ti card) and I guess the only concern is she doesn\'t want me to wanna use it all the time, so i better make sure it\'s not better than mine.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the more low hanging fruit would be to just get another low-end HP Pavillion style with an Intel Pentium CPU or AMD equivalent, but with a 17"" display, and buy it new so it\'s better than the refurb Pavillion I got her in 2013 when we were poor.\r\n\r\nWith that, thanks for all your feedback. Buying a laptop is always a long process for me, thanks for your continuing support.\r\n\r\nEDIT AGAIn: Damnit, lol, it looks like right now is a terrible time to buy a laptop.

Profane_Champion,"[""So, I have two things to say, but I think you would want to hear the religious aspect first:  \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no way of actually knowing god's intention, or claiming that you do. There is no reason why god couldn't make someone be both a boy and a girl (as a matter of fact, it happens already and regularly) or anything else. I don't know what denomination of Christianity you follow, but it's also true that the new testament doesn't say anything against LGBTQIA; there are just different interpretations. Homosexuality has also been documented in hundreds of different species, from other primates to penguins and beyond.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSecond, the way you describe your identity sounds like you're bigender- identifying with two different genders. I identify as bigender too, though I'm both a girl and demiboy. <SUBREDDIT> is a nice place to go to talk to people who feel similarly. Either way, you're identity's valid and I wish you luck."", ""I identify as bisexual, but I'm romantically closer to pan. I've never felt the need to come out about the difference because to any outside observer they're pretty much the same. Even if I did state the difference though my family isn't exactly knowledgeable in the topic, so it would end up confusing them even further (they readily admit that they 'don't get' bisexuality.)"", ""No. For bisexual people, our preference towards any gender doesn't affect how satisfied we are in a relationship; the proportions that we feel in attraction more regard our tendency to whom we feel that attraction.\r\n I have an inclination towards men, so looking at any group of people chances are I'm going to be more attracted to the men of that group than the women. Should I get into a relationship with someone regardless of gender, I would be just as satisfied if they were another."", ""Other people aren't able to determine what your sexuality is; only you. Intimacy also come in many forms; not just the interactions of people's nethers, mouths, and hands. Consider the things that you're attracted to and that you enjoy, and remember that romantic and intimate attraction are different. Here are some terms that might help you to think about things:\r\n\r\nAndro- and Gyno- reflect attraction to men and women respectively; Bi- is an attraction to any two, and doesn't have to be a 50/50 split; it could be 1/99, 70/30, or anywhere in between (for me personally, the split is 2/98); Pan- denotes an attraction to people in general, but shouldn't be confused with ploygamy, which is an ability to have multiple loves.  \r\nThere is also demi-, which is where a strong bond must be established with a person before there's any attraction, which can be added to any of the above. For good measure I'll also mention Ace, which is being devoid of attraction.\r\n\r\nIn the end, you're the only person who can describe what your attractions are; I hope having some vocabulary and names for things helps.""]",NB

Steve200900,"['So... I brainstormed some Stand ideas, What\'cha think? \n [Stand Name] |User Name|: Description\nSo about a day or two ago I posted a... post titled ""So I need a little help with names."" I got a good response and started brainstorming Stand ideas... Here\'s what I came up with.\nIf you wanna know about the users/Stands go ahead and ask!\n\n[Zeus] | L. Kevin Hamnu|: A Stand with immense power and semi-precise movements. \nAppearance: His appearance is a simple, handsome, bearded man. \nElectric Spear: The Stand throws a simple bolt of lightning at a foe. The lightning bolt‚Äôs path can be changed and altered. More than one at a time can be thrown, and it goes about 10 meters\n‚ÄúOra Ora‚Äù Punches: The Stand throws a flurry of fists at the enemy, causing pretty severe damage when connected. However this only goes as far as the Stand‚Äôs arm length.\nCharged Fists: When activated, the Stand‚Äôs fists produce electricity, this can be, obviously, combined with ‚ÄúOra Ora‚Äù Punches to give significantly more damage than either separate. This ability can also be channeled to the Stand user‚Äôs fists, but not to the User and Stand at the same time.\nPower: A  Speed: B  Range: C  Durability: B  Precision: B  Potential: A\n\n[Kishi] |M. Ciara Hamnu|: A stand with incredibly fast and precise movements, It‚Äôs a Knight-like stand with Six arms. \n‚ÄúOra Ora‚Äù Stabs: Essentially, The Six arms allow it to strike many times within seconds\nSword Fighter: It is trained to swordfight with precision, and it can strike and expertly remove the opponent‚Äôs weapons. \nPower: B  Speed: A  Range: B  Precision: A  Potential: B\n\n[Perpetuum Strike] |S. Will|: This Stand is similar to Hermit Purple, as it acts on the user‚Äôs arms and legs. \nElement Switch: The stand can switch the between all of the elements at will. This allows for combinations of the Stand‚Äôs different powers. \nElement Launch: The stand can throw various projectiles based on the current active element. \nPower: B  Speed: B-C  Range: B-C  Precision: B  Potential: A\n\n[Za Walker] Song: The Walker\nWalk to the beat of my own drum: ""Area of Effect"" Stand, The Stand doesn\'t have humanoid projection. Allows user to Speed up and slow down the objects and creatures around him in about a 2 meter radius, however the Stand can\'t stop objects completely. It can also slightly alter the direction/trajectory of the object in question. Doesn\'t affect Stand/Stand Users within the radius. Objects flung at the user, if slowed down by user, resume original velocity upon leaving 2M radius. Allows for Matrix moves, if the user feels like it.\nPower: B-C  Speed: B-C  Range: C  Durability: B-C  Precision: B-C  Potential: A\n\n[A Little Less Conversation] Song: A Little Less Conversation\nA Little Less Conversation: This Ability, when activated, forces nearby people, in a 4 meter radius, to shorten their conversations, leaving out crucial details. \nFunky Groove: This Ability is passive, if someone tries to attack the user, they will Dance out of the way of the attack, if the user isn‚Äôt too tired to dance. \nThe stand can take a humanoid form, but the User doesn‚Äôt summon it much. The Stand is semi-robotic, wears a pompadour and is either constantly tapping its foot, nodding its head or moving its shoulders slightly. \nPower: C  Speed: C  Range: B  Durability: B  Precision: B  Potential: A\n\n[Hero of the Storm]\n\n[The Captain] ""Captain Falcon""\nShow me your moves: Subtly influences opponents to attack them with all of their moves, effective within 5 Meter Radius. This Stand is essentially a shield, It has massive power but extremely slow movements because of its Heavy Armor. The Stand has almost unbreakable armor, allowing it withstand most attacks. However if the Armor is, somehow, broken its power drops dramatically, it\'s speed is boosted, and the durability drops drastically. The Design of the Stand is humanoid, with large muscles and detailed plate armor. \n(Armor on) Power: A  Speed: E  Range: D  Durability: A  Precision: C  Potential: B\n(Armor Broken) Power: C  Speed: B  Range: D  Durability: E  Precision: B  Potential: B\n\n[Hera] |Mrs. Sharla Hamnu| A.k.a. Heidi|: Her Stand is more bird-like than Humanoid. It looks like a Swan, with a wingspan of about 10 feet. \nHealing/Repair: This ability allows her to heal minor cuts on her body and wounds on others. It can also rebuild objects, in a similar manner to how the Manor repairs itself. Because of the Wingspan of her Stand, She can glide, and flap her wings to gain altitude. However this is a risky ability as normal humans can‚Äôt see Stands.\nPower: B  Speed: B  Range: A  Durability: C  Precision: B  Potential: B\n\n[Poseidon] |Faust|: This Stand is ‚Äòworn‚Äô by the user and takes a form of a trident, transparent and blue in color. \nKing of the Sea: If the user touches the Stand to water, it will control said water. It can also manipulate various other forms of water, such as ice, frost, steam etc. The Stand can also change the form of the water it touches, but only in the progression of steam-water-ice, and back. \nNot quite a God: This ability of the stand, when activated, allows the user to skate across water, as if on ice (without ice skates of course). This ability goes only for about 10 minutes, providing that the user doesn‚Äôt get tired.\nPower: B-C  Speed: B  Range: E  Durability: C  Precision: D  Potential: B\n\n[Demeter]: ‚ÄòStand plants‚Äô can grow at a whim and can control existing plants to various degrees \n\n[Athena] \n\n[Apollo & Artemis]: Stand users are Twins\n\n[Ares]\n\n[Aphrodite] |Karla|: The stand user is an exhibitionist, and wears a loose skirt around her waist, but not much else. \n\n[Hephaestus]\n\n[Hermes]: Stand abilities include transferring information long distances through telepathy, slight hovering, and has way with merchants and clerks.\n\n[Hestia]: A soft stand, very quiet. It doesn‚Äôt do well in direct confrontations but is a good support stand.\n\n[Dionysus]: Similar to Demeter, Summons ‚ÄòStand Plants‚Äô to entangle and attack enemies. \n\n[Hades]', 'HOLY FUCK ITS REAL ACTUAL IIDA TENYA /s', 'Wip \n <BOLD> Author Preface: I\'m a huge JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure, so stay away if you don\'t wanna get wrapped up in stands and shit\n\nAt about sunset, I hear a random thought.

Just need to rant. \r\n\r\nI gave birth to my beautiful baby boy at the end of October last year (oh right, it‚Äôs 2020 now!). He‚Äôs now almost 10 weeks old. I was dead set on exclusively breastfeeding him from the get go, because that‚Äôs what our bodies were built for, right??? Well...\r\n\r\nI took the breastfeeding class, read the breastfeeding books and pamphlets and websites, thought ‚Äúhow hard could this really be?‚Äù But no one could‚Äôve prepared me for how difficult, taxing, demanding this whole process has been and how abandoned I‚Äôve truly felt.\r\n\r\nI was induced, hemorrhaged more blood during delivery, and baby was jaundiced following delivery (needed bili lights). My milk was late to come in, I really didn‚Äôt feel like I had much colostrum, and baby‚Äôs latch was so painful my nipples were rubbed raw and scabbed. The hospital lactation consultant casually mentioned baby had a ‚Äúslight tongue tie‚Äù but left it at that. I thought nothing of it, just that maybe I was failing at something that should‚Äôve been ~natural~ and biologically destined for the both of us. Anyway, I broke down in the hospital after a night of continuous hunger crying and gave him donor milk, and we gave him formula the first nights home because of the same issue.\r\n\r\nDespite almost exclusively breastfeeding him now (my partner feeds him 1-2 bottles of expressed milk or formula a day so I can sleep) we‚Äôre still barely getting to the bottom of our nursing issues... but not because of the guidance from doctors, the lactation consultant, or nurses (shout out to the moms in the FB group I‚Äôm in for being so helpful!).\r\n\r\nThe LC I saw 2 and 3 weeks PP gave me such a judgy, all-or-nothing attitude with respect to breastfeeding that I gave her a hearty Fuck You when she told me to cancel our 3rd appointment if I decided against exclusively putting him to breast (like, no bottles, no pumping AT ALL). She didn‚Äôt seem bothered to help with my supply (weighted feeds showed baby wasn‚Äôt transferring enough) other than telling me that all I needed to do was EBF. Ha, yeah right... Both times I left her office I felt more disheartened than before. And she wondered why I was showing signs of PPD...üôÑ \r\n\r\nWell, after weeks of personal research, the FB group, and rough home assessments, I‚Äôm convinced our problems with low/barely enough supply, painful and shallow latches, extended feedings (sometimes over TWO HOURS and ALWAYS over 45-60min), and trouble transferring milk are due to that goddamn tongue tie and possible lip tie. NO ONE told me this was something that could devastate our breastfeeding relationship, despite being a relatively quick revision. NO ONE bothered to look beyond blaming me for giving him bottles as the reason for having a lower milk supply. And here I am, over 2 months PP just beginning to piece this shit together on my own while dealing with PPD.\r\n\r\nI just feel so fucking screwed over by the people that are supposed to be experts, supposed to help you figure all this VERY NEW shit out. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve agonized over breastfeeding my child, feeling guilty for giving him formula, being saddened by a meager pump output. The pediatrician, the hospital nurses, the lactation consultants, etc. all emphasize how /important/ breastfeeding is and heavily encourage it, but they leave you hanging when any problems other than a simple latch issue arise. Well, how the FUCK else was I going to know?!? It‚Äôs not my job! My only job is to keep this precious little human alive and fed and loved and content but I can‚Äôt do that properly if you can‚Äôt help me identify WHY it‚Äôs all so hard!!! \r\n\r\nMy rockstar of a partner has aided in all the research, scheduled an appointment with a pediatric dentist to check for those mouth ties and other possible oral motor issues, is going to schedule baby in for bodyworking sessions, and has overall been as supportive as humanly possible as the non-breastfeeding parent. Seriously, bless her fucking heart. I hope the combo of these things, as well as finding a new LC, magically fixes things, but only time will tell. \r\n\r\nAll I‚Äôve learned from this is that you have to be your own and your baby‚Äôs biggest advocate, because sometimes the people that should give a fuck about your problems don‚Äôt actually care to look beyond the surface. \r\n\r\nBreastfeed, combo feed, formula feed.

We had a lot of other party members come in and out, but for this story the only one who matters is our human cleric, let\'s call him Steve since I\'ve got a story about a game he GMed as well and I like having names for reoccurring characters.\r\n\r\nSo, first off Steve was the GM\'s son, which might be how he got away with some of the shit he pulled. He claimed to have read every book for 3e and 3.5 but never cited the sources for anything he used to my recollection. I know he had the Rebuke Undead ability and he had some feat or variant or something that allowed him to take control of undead he successfully rebukes with no apparent limit as to how many he can control. He almost instantly got 5 skeletons under his command and he eventually gave them bows, he later got a wraith and two undead minotaurs. He referred to this collection as ""The Army of Dorkness"". On top of all of that, he eventually got a spellcasting bear as a mount, so, already he can stomp things using just his army and mount.\r\n\r\nBut that isn\'t all, he also acquired some +2 full plate, a +2 tower shield, and a cloak of displacement, so, nothing can hit him and anything that does has a 50% chance to just not. Then he acquired what he referred to as a replica of Sauron\'s mace from the start of the first Lord of the Rings movie. It was a +3 large (he had monkey grip) that imposed a DC15 fort save to not be knocked back 10 feet and, weather you pass it or not, a DC15 ref save to not be knocked prone, as well as 1d6 damage of any type other than slashing, piercing and bludgeoning, which can be changed as a free action. I believe he also had winged sandals but the party collectively had like 4 pairs of the things so that wasn\'t too special.\r\n\r\nWith all of this (plus some suspiciously high stats and good rolls) he was already strong enough to fight the entire rest of the party and win, with some hit points to spare since he never multiclassed and so was still getting cleric levels, giving him plenty of wound curing. But that wasn\'t enough for him, he did some kind of ritual to become half fire elemental, dealing damage to anyone who came in physical contact, becoming immune to fire and gaining the ability to cast Fire Storm and Wall of Fire at least once each per day at his divine caster level. At that point the party were just an afterthought to him, he didn\'t need us and none of us were having fun since he would just singlehandedly steamroll everything.\r\n\r\n A few session after he became a fire elemental and promptly retouted the entire campaign to the elemental plane of fire for reasons I don\'t remember the GM got fed up with his shit and canned the campaign entirely.\r\n\r\nTL:DR: GM\'s son abuses rules and probly does some homebrew that he claims is legit and becomes so strong that the rest of the party are not needed, since the GM wasn\'t mean enough to the rest of us to build encounters only he could have any chance of handling.']",M

Ownard,"['Friend (19F) who rejected me (19M) genuinely thinks she hasn\'t - advice needed! \n Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI could use some advice on a situation of mine. \r\n\r\nRecently, I caught feelings for a close friend and expressed my feelings to her. She said that because of her antidepressants, she isn\'t able to feel emotions too well and wishes to stay friends until she can figure herself out. I took that as a soft rejection and proposed that we should take some time apart so that I can move on from my feelings and maybe we can be friends after that.\r\n\r\nHowever, things appeared to have gone differently than I had planned. Over the 2-3week period we weren\'t supposed to be talking, we each broke the silence occasionally, sometime by accident and sometimes on purpose. Recently however, she commented me on a Snapchat story of mine and we started talking. All of a sudden, she messages ""I miss you, when can we meet?""\r\n\r\nI was shocked at this and wanted to know why but I didn\'t have time to text and find out so I said we could talk later if she wanted to come over after my shift. Well, she didn\'t. So I was like ""cool, I set aside some time for you come and say your piece, but i don\'t want anymore bullshit, so please don\'t mess me about.""\r\n\r\nShe asked to meet the next day, I took some time to think and agreed, one of my friends said it would be better to have this talk in public incase she tries anything. We had a nice catch up then we had the talk. \r\n\r\nAccording to her, she didn\'t reject me. She just said that she was in a bad place and didn\'t want to get into anything. She said that right now, she misses me and wants me there to support her, that she broke up with the other guy she was seeing and didn\'t want to label us. This sent me into a bit of a mental tailspin so I kinda shut off and got defensive, insisting that it was a rejection and that while I care about her, I am doubtful of my ability to move on while being close friends. After some more emotional back and forth and going in circles, we agreed that now isn\'t the time for either of us to make decisions as she wasn\'t feeling great and I was stressed from work. I work in an emergency department.\r\n\r\nI think right now I do want to be friends with her, but I need to set the pretense that I am trying to move on from her, so there will be new boundaries and a bit more distance than before.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? I really think that she is an amazing woman, and if she wasn\'t in a dark place, she would be the perfect person for me to be with. I do want her in my life, but I am aware there are landmines, the main one being her depression.\r\n\r\nAny advice is appreciated!', 'I fell for a close friend, and now the friendship has ended, and I hate that it came to this. \n To start this, we are both 19. She is probably the person I trusted the most and we shared to much personal shit and were vunerable with each other so much. We grew really close and I enjoyed every minute of the time I had with her. She is an amazing woman and I would love to have her back into my life but I don\'t think that possible anymore.\r\n\r\nNaturally, over time I started to fall for her as we got really close. And I thought it was mutual. We started hugging all the time, hanging out at each others, holding hands, hell, she even slept with me(no sex) on Halloween rather than get a taxi home. I really thought things were pointing that we could start dating. But she could tell something was up with me and kept pressuring me until I confessed. At first she was shocked, and told me that she doesn\'t want a relationship right now but despite that she wanted me in her life and still be close. \r\n\r\nI took this as a rejection and said that I\'m going to need time to process my feelings and start moving on before we can be friends again. I just don\'t think it can be healthy when one party wants more than the other is willing to give. She said okay and that was that. \r\n\r\nFast forward a week and she asks if we can meet up because she misses me and is going through a hard time and needs me. I agree to meeting for coffee so I still have an escape if I need. Turns out, while I\'ve been away she spiraled down into depression and got worse. I told her that I am here if she needs me but I\'d prefer if she leaves that to emergencies because I am moving on. She asked why and I replied that because she rejected me, I need to deal with my unrequited feelings before we can be true friends. She proceeded to tell me that it wasn\'t a rejection, that she didn\'t want to label us and why can\'t we just go with the flow. She gave me hope and that was my mistake.\r\n\r\nI met her again a couple days later because I she was having a breakdown and came to me for help, so I went to help. I also went over because I had something I wanted to talk to someone I trust about. However, once it was solved and the conversation evolved, it became clear that I had hot my hopes up for nothing. I slept on it and decided to message her: ""I needed to do my own thing for a while, I\'m sorry if you feel I have wasted your time but I need to get over you before we can be friends"".\r\n\r\nShe blew up at this and had a meltdown. She blamed me for being selfish and being childish because I didn\'t get what I wanted. I realized she didn\'t care about me. She didn\'t take into account me while she melting down.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I regret the way this whole situation played out. I wanted to say that I just needed a break but she took it out the ballpark. I wanted to be able to be friends once I sorted my feeling out but that doesn\'t seem possible.\r\n\r\nI\'m thinking about sending a Christmas card to her once the dust settles in the hopes that maybe when we are more mature, maybe we can be friends then.', 'I agree.
