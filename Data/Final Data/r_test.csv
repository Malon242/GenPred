Patchirisu,"[""What's your optimal genital setup? \n I made a post on <SUBREDDIT> recently that made me realize that, while many people want only their gender's standard genitals, many people, including myself, want both, or some other kind of unusual combination. And not just NBs, binary trans people, too. \n\nSo what do you want? It can be anything, nothing's off the table. It could be a standard setup, something realistic through surgery, something medically ahead of us, or something completely fantastical. \n\nI think I have 2 optimal stetups. The first is a vagina and clitoris, and above that, a dick. Balls, too I guess, but I'd really only want them so I could cum, I'm not really interested in having them just to have them. So, I guess if we're allowing fantastical and impossible genitals, I guess really I'd want a pussy and dick, with no balls, but the ability to cum anyway.\n\nMy second optimal setup is much more... magical. Now, my favorite and most wanted superpower for a while now has been anatomical liberation, the ability to detach your body parts and while detached they work just as if they were still on you. So, I'd want a dick, with balls in this case, that could be removed, revealing a secret pussy underneath. This would be so great for me, because I'd be able to have both experiences, which is really what I'm after, I don't want to miss out on either. I'd also be able to remove my dick and play with it, while I could still feel it, and that would just be so much fun. I could suck it, use it as a dildo and fuck myself, just leave it at home or in my bag instead of tucking, give it to someone else and let them entertain themselves without me, while still feeling everything they do, oh God there are just so many ways it could be used. \n\nSo, I'm interested to what you guys are interested in. Maybe, even if you don't really want to have them, you could just make up some setups that you think are interesting."", ""And don't forget murder and get away with it."", '[Picture] Saw this at school.

ahoohaahooha,"[""Check out their FB page, I JUST saw a post pop up on my feed today. They say it's coming to a few theaters in May/June"", 'Nothing works on my conservative family, but that might work on yours. If you have a ""deep conversation"" kind of relationship with her or it\'s important to you to understand each other, you might unpack that. Why does it bother her so much? Does she see it as a reflection of her parenting? Does she understand this is an expression of your identity & what makes you content, & that her parenting shaped you into a person who chooses to be who she is?\r\n\r\nAnyway, totally agree with <USER>. You\'re gay/bi all the time, it\'s part of your identity, & you don\'t need any further validation except knowing yourself, though it feels good. I had a similar track: LTR with guy, short period of questioning bi vs. gay. I was pretty sure, final step was that first girl kiss in 5 years & it was done: ""wtf was I thinking, I never want to do <ITALIC> anything but this, definitely 1000% gay"". I\'m not sure having a gf would help you solidify the gay label since you\'re already fine with bi, but rather thinking about men (men you meet, see, or have dated/fucked) & thinking ""would I like to be involved with them in any physical way? would I enjoy it?"" Really dig into your own desires & try to separate out the thoughts & compulsions that come from socialization, media, pressure, history. I realize I\'m focusing on physical stuff there, & while there\'s much more to a relationship, I really think that\'s the line between friends & romantic relationships. I\'ve had closer emotional relationships with platonic friends or hookups than some people I\'ve dated.\r\n\r\nIn regards to coming out to family, I was on that same fence. Then I read something about how, if you don\'t expect positive acceptance or they are conservative (mine are), they will have trouble making sense of it, so waiting until you have a gf could cause them to assign blame to her for ""turning you gay"", ""corrupting you"", ""pressuring you"", miscellaneous other bullshit. So I decided for me it was important to show them this is who I am regardless of anyone else\'s influences or involvement. And them being in very conservative christian communities, I wanted to be the one to start the ripple. You know how they say when a person knows someone who is gay, they are more likely to move in an accepting direction & spread that to their network. For you, I would get to a little more comfortable level with your current place on the spectrum before making any moves (don\'t wait for 100%), because it will affect what you say. And you want to be confident in what you say, stumbling leads to them assuming ""phase"". But know that you are not in a race, you are not too old for this (I was 29), you are not locked in to a label, & you absolutely do not <ITALIC> owe anyone an explanation on anything. Sexuality & life are hard to figure out with the way most of us grow up. Surround yourself with people who know that compersion & acceptance are far more valuable than judgment & vicarious drama.

You fill in the blank: drink, go to a dog park even though I don\'t have a dog, people watch, makeout, play board games, cuddle, misc sexy times...\r\n\r\nHer: 29 (still get carded for being 18), bi (I\'ve dated women, not party girl bi), 5\'6"", white (very), brunette, average/fit-ish body, dom-ish. A little tomboyish but cute, just not girly. Some makeup, no dresses/purses/heels/etc. Celebrity likenesses I\'ve gotten are Alyson Hannigan (I don\'t see it) & Michelle Trachtenberg (smaller boobs. seriously hers are great though). Small tattoos/piercings.\r\n\r\nHim: 35, heteroflexible, 5\'8"", white, brunette, sometimes bearded, average body, former military, outdoorsy, sexually adventurous, GGG. Some piercings & a half sleeve. He strangely has no likenesses that I\'ve discovered yet.\r\n\r\nSome ideals of ours (not requirements): You: female, bi, <5\'7"", <38C. Recently tested & truthful about STI status (note this does not mean you have to be sparkling clean.) Also, I don\'t care what it is, but know what you want.\r\n\r\nMore ideals: Would love to find a good FWB that we really are friends with, one-on-one play & hangouts are cool as well as group. 50-50 & constant 3-way is unrealistic. Personally, flirting is one of my favorite parts of life. No rules aside from the STI thing. Our relationship is vaguely open to whatever life brings.\r\n\r\nWe\'re laid back, secure, enjoy wine-tasting, long beach walks... oh god I can\'t continue the cliches, but the first 2 are true. Limited free time, but we like bars (not huge drinkers because it normally ends with us saying ""we\'re too old for this shit""), concerts/shows, bowling, board games, LS clubs, bonfires, baseball, standup, etc. Can host or can drive.\r\n\r\nPM me or KIK: lindsayishere05\r\n\r\nP.S.

Your name (your preferred one, not necessarily your legal name) . Address, phone number, health card. And 3 pics of your chest. Head not needed in the pic.\r\n\r\nThey also had a box to check if you didn't want them mailing you anything to your address which is nice for those who want to keep things on the down low.\r\n\r\n3) Phone Consultation \r\nCalled me 20min after scheduled time, no big deal.\r\nI forget her name but the secretary was very nice. \r\nWe discussed how I was going to pay, (out of pocket), height, weight, any meds. She asked if I did any research or knew anything about chest surgery. I did, and listed off my thoughts. If I didn't she would have explained everything. She also said they have an Instagram with top surgery results, which I didn't know, and am going to look at.\r\n\r\nDr.Mclean was on the phone so she passed me to Liz who you usually speak with after the Dr.\r\n\r\nLiz was very nice as well, she said the only issue would be my BMI. She was very polite about this, for anyone sensitive about their weight, they would be great. I know I'm fat and need to lose weight, I said this. She explained it was the anesthesiologist who would have the issue, and for better healing it's better as well. I asked how soon from the consult could I get surgery, assuming my BMI was good. \r\n\r\nShe said in usually 4-6 weeks, depending on season it may be longer. I said obviously I can't book it now, so how do I? She said when I have my BMI lower, just email her to arrange and I have to pay a 10% deposit for the date ($964ish) and then the rest 2 weeks before. They accept credit card, mail order, and check. \r\n\r\nDr. McLean was still on another call, so he called me back about 15min later.\r\n\r\nDr.McLean was very nice as well. He asked how I identified, if I had a bf/gf, if i was out, where i worked, my feeling towards my chest, if I was on testosterone, if I bind, why I wanted to pay out of pocket, why now for surgery, when did I first think of surgery, why did I pick this clinic? Etc. Nothing hard.\r\n\r\nHe politely explained his concerns of my BMI, (it was amusing to be because they were all so polite and I'm like yeah I'm fat I get it lol)\r\n\r\nHe said yes, double incision, and listed the possible risks of surgery and how I felt about them. \r\n\r\nHe asked if I had any questions, I asked about return to work, as I had read conflicting reports and have a physical job. If I had desk duty 2-3 weeks, any exercise or heavy lifting 6 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo to get top surgery I need to:\r\n\r\nLose 50lbs\r\n\r\nGet My Parents on Board (they know I want surgery but I haven't actually told them I want to now.

Kool-Kukumber,"['Would it be right to call them one of the most influential bands of the 21st century? So many artists point to them as an inspiration', ""Daily Song Discussion - Dan Abnormal (The Great Escape) \n Dan Abnormal is the song we’re covering today and it’s a bit of an unique one. While the song is yet another character study, this character is actually Damon himself; Dan Abnormal is an anagram of Damon Albarn. The song entails that while Damon engages in many of the same activities as regular people, such as drinking and watching TV, his position as a entertainer means he’s not “normal at all” in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nMusically I’d say this is one of the most ‘Britpop-y’ songs they ever made. A big reason for this is the backing vocals, which engage in a chorus of ‘la-la-las” throughout the song. The track is also notable for being one of the few Blur songs we’ve seen so far to feature a guitar solo, even though the guitar work on the track does remain distinctly Graham.\r\n\r\nLyrical highlight: “Dan Abnormal, not normal at all, It's not his fault, we made him this way”\r\n\r\nMusical highlight: Guitar work\r\n\r\nBest performance: Damon, Graham\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>"", 'I mean I’ll admit it’s not my favourite song on the album, and I do prefer the spacey songs on 13 over the more punk ones. But imo it’s still pretty decent and I think it does fit in the album considering there’s other heavy punk songs like Bugman and B.L.U.R.E.M.I. If Swamp Song doesn’t fit then those songs don’t fit either.', ""Daily Song Discussion - Look Inside America (S/T) \n Next song up in the discussions is Look Inside America, which definitely calls back to Blur’s previous style and sound. The song’s lyrics serves as a reflection on the band’s relationship with America, as Damon claims that despite being forced to pander to the US market through acts such as appearing on ‘second rate chat show(s)’, he has come to accept America for what it is. While it is not his kind of country, he ultimately has to stop trying to ‘make her mine’, and come to the conclusion that as a whole, America isn’t all that bad.\r\n\r\nMusically the song bears a very strong resemblance to End Of The Century, to the degree that it almost seems like a musical sequel to that song. It starts simply with Damon and some acoustic guitar before gradually other elements are brought into the song, most notably a strings section that gives the song a nice, dramatic touch.\r\n\r\nLyrical highlight: “Got to play a second rate chat show, It's a nationwide deal, so you got to go, Chuck from the company says it'll be alright, Got an ad on KROQ and there's an in-store tonight”\r\n\r\nMusical highlight: Strings\r\n\r\nBest performer: Damon\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>""]",M

While I’m not involved in this situation and thus can’t speak to what’s the actual root cause of this, if I had to guess based upon my experiences with disabled family members, my personal journey with severe mental and physical illnesses, and my studies on the topic I’d say something like this:\r\n\r\nWhen you’re severely impaired, all filters are gone. If you’re at a spot it sounds like your BIL is, it’s immensely frustrating. You know something is wrong, that your brain isn’t right, but you have no way of fixing it. This results in an inability to live a normal life, or to properly form relationships with others. Throw in the toxicity and excuses for hatred towards groups of people found upon the internet, and you get a person unable to properly empathize or properly relate to others. \r\n\r\nWhile your response is completely understandable to this situation (you are not an asshole), as your BIL IS still doing these toxic things, I’d recommend yourself and people in this thread remember he cannot properly function. \r\n\r\nOP, my personal take is that you should talk with your husband about what steps his family can take at the moment, such as internet blockers and researching more treatment options and small changes that can be made to help him realize he IS loved and DOES have a place in this world. Many severely mentally impaired people that lash out do so because they want love and connection, but don’t know how to find it within the outside world. OP, your current actions are completely justified, but please remain open to a future connection with your BIL after time passes. \r\n\r\nAnd for people in comments who say they have a mental impairment and that doesn’t excuse BIL behaviors, please consider that you don’t know the gravity of his disability. I know how hard having disabilities can be, and also don’t excuse these types of behaviors in people that share my disabilities at a lower or equal level of severity.

So many folks who grow up in church are told from a very young age not to have sex before marriage. Very rarely does church tell you why. Or if they do, they tell you, “Because the Bible says so.” THAT IS NOT A SUFFICIENT ANSWER. Do your research. Find books on the topic (here’s one I highly recommend). Pray for the Holy Spirit to convict and guide you.\n \t\tI looked back at my promiscuity and finally saw how destructive it had been to my life, and to my spirit. It made sense to me—because of my own experience—why it’s better to wait.\n<ITALIC>  \t\tI decided on my own that I wanted to wait. I didn’t let my husband or anyone else sway or inform my decision. It was a commitment I made to God, and to myself.\n \t\tI asked God for forgiveness, and understood that Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross meant that forgiveness, freedom and a fresh start were mine to claim.\n<ITALIC>  \t\tI confessed my past sexual sins to my husband, and then asked him for forgiveness. This might not make sense to some of you, but in a way I felt like I’d denied him an experience he’d spent his whole life waiting for. I’d already opened the present he’d been eagerly anticipating, and was now bringing a lot of physical and emotional baggage into our marriage.\n \t\tHe forgave me.\n<ITALIC>  \t\tWe decided not to live together before marriage. This was another big shift from my old life. I’d lived with two previous boyfriends for several years each. Again, this was another counter-cultural decision we made. We just simply could not see ourselves staying committed to abstinence sleeping in the same bed every night.\n \t\tIn fact, we never slept in the same bed together. If either of us ever fell asleep watching tv or a movie on the couch at the other’s apartment, no matter how late it was or tired we were, we would get in our car and drive back to our own home. At times, this was painfully difficult. But we stayed committed.\n<ITALIC>  \t\tFor us, no sex meant no sex of any kind—if you catch my drift. No loopholes. Besides, it’d be hard to imagine stopping ourselves at certain acts. Foreplay without the play would just be self-torture.\n \t\tWe learned how to be intimate and vulnerable in other ways. We shared secrets, told each other things we’d never told anyone before.

How to fight well (got lots of practice there). Relationships take a whole lot of work aside from the fun stuff, so we figured why not get some of that work done early so we’d have more time for fun when we’re married. I’m convinced our abstinence is why our relationship feels as mature as it does despite us only being together a few years.\n \t\tWe slipped up. I am not one to put on a front or pretend to be perfect. There were absolutely times we felt like we went further than we should have. But whenever we did, we talked about it and we prayed about it.

Nancy_Bluerain,"['I never played wow, so I can’t make a comparison on any level. Can only compare it to Lineage II and Aion. In those two, there is no side questing. There used to be and they were really cool. Some times you even had to hunt mobs and do side quests to reach the minimum level for the main story, but that didn’t really go well with western audiences who absolutely hate grinding. But to me, that’s what it made the game so much more. Role playing as it should have been, go to places, pretend that Hunter’s Village is my home, or Dion is my favourite town, or Heine my favourite holiday destination... Added some extra to the backstory, as well as non-essential gear. All of which is gone now. There is just the main quest series to level you up to cap in a weekend and nothing else. Both of them got their souls ripped out.\n\nI don’t see that in Tera. I played when the game first launched in the west, and it still feels as good as it used to. I have my favourite places, I go on holiday to the beaches just north of Cutthroat Harbour, and so on.\n\nThe side quests can also be done parallel to the main, which is great, or you can focus on the main story and come back to the sides later.\n\nWhat I find really great (and I do realise that opinions may be divided on this one) is that side quests don’t give you XP. But they do give you essential items, potions, enchantment supplies, and money (though the latter isn’t really worth it unless you have a subscription and get the double money multiplier). Perfect if you just want to take a little break from the main story and just chill for a while without levelling too far and risk making the main quest series too easy.\n\nSides also take you places that didn’t fit in the main, and they provide more to the story, expanding on the lore where the main series would have been too packed otherwise.\n\nAnd like I said in my OP, even the main story will take you back to some beginner areas and let you explore more of the map. Places where you have been before and give you more story elements that make things that much more interesting.\n\nL2 and Aion just force you to power through the early game with no offer to explore at all, but Tera lets you choose whether you want to level up as fast as possible, or take the scenic route and see the whole world. Even the story is quite engaging. With a bit of excitement and sense of urgency, conspiracies, betrayal, twists (some you can see coming a mile away, others will leave you with goosebumps).\n\nI would even go as far as to say that Tera in it’s current state is what Aion should have been from the beginning. Not that surprising, however, if you consider that the early developers of Tera we the ones who developed Lineage II. And Lineage II used to be great up until NC$oft messed up and a good chunk of the devs left to make Bluehole Studios who eventually created Tera. (NC even used them when Tera was still in development because they allegedly took some code and concept artwork with them that was meant for Lineage 3. Well... where is Lineage 3, then? Nowhere. Because those who made Tera are the ones who originally worked for NC on the Lineage project).\n\nTake it to the extreme and you can even say that Tera is actually Lineage 3 (which isn’t that far from the truth actually. A lot of things that are in Tera were early concepts for Lineage 3). And if you look closely enough, you will find a number of similarities to the classic Lineage II.\n\nAnyway, I shut up now.

I do this at my shop (7-10 petrol station with some dodgy people) and it works. In my case it’s easier to justify and I can use the fact that we are a licensed store (we sell alcohol and tobacco) as a loophole to ban people I don’t like. I only ever had to use that once, but in more legitimate cases, the second anyone harasses my staff, they’re banned. Being a petrol station also make it that much easier, because of the nature of the business, we have a zero tolerance policy on abuse and harassment.\n\nIn any case, when I ban someone, I spend some time on the CCTV to look for a good picture of the person and get their vehicle information if they have one, including number plate. I then print it and file it to the do not serve folder which is available to all staff.\n\nI found the hardest part is getting everyone to follow the do not serve list. Some staff argue that they had no issues with that person or “they can handle them” and don’t realise that when they serve them, not only is it disrespectful to their colleagues, but it’s also an invitation to more abuse towards the victim. As they might keep returning and give hard time to the victim for not serving them while “but your colleagues served me, so you don’t get to refuse to serve me”.\n\nStaff needs to understand that they have to work together, and not serving dns people is also part of their job, just like it is to serve others.\n\nA panic button that is connected to the local police station can also be useful. It saves time and in some cases can prevent the incident to escalate further by hiding the alarm (calling the police) from the customer.\n\nPs: En taro Adun!

I browse a bunch of trans subs, but still cis though.', ""I agree that trans people should tell their partner or partners that they are trans before having sex, if she hasn't gotten vaginoplasty (as in she still has a penis). If a trans woman has a vagina, then I don't think that she has to tell someone that she used to have a penis.\r\n\r\n\r\n<QUOTE>\n\r\nThe World Health Organization made an article about how sex and gender are two different things <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. I agree with the article that gender has to do with your brain, and not your genitalia. So I think that trans women should only be called trans women when it's relevant in a conversation. By this, I mean that cisgender women are never referred as cisgender unless it has to do with the conversation. I think that the same should be done with trans women.\r\n\r\n<QUOTE>\n\r\nYou personally have those feelings, and it's fine to feel deceived, but I think that rape is a word a bit too extreme. Rape is when someone does something sexual to you without you saying yes, or they force you into a sexual act. If at any point you say no to something but your partner keeps going, that counts as rape. If you were to have sex with a trans woman but she didn't say she's trans, then you would end up knowing she's trans by seeing her penis. If you wouldn't want to have sex with someone with a penis, you could say that you don't want to keep going.""]",M

The woman who ran my appointment was really nice (annoyingly, the room was too bright). I scored 44/50 on the AQ 50, so I'll be moving on to the next step. IIRC, I'll be doing another test and then something else (my memory is bad). It's through my uni, which makes things easier. I'm really proud of myself for doing this. For complicated reasons that I'll explain in brief, I didn't realise I was autistic until very recently.\r\n\r\n I'm trans non-binary AFAB (Assigned Female at Birth). Trans-non-binary can mean a lot of things, but to me it means that I'm somewhere between Agender  and trans masc. If you're confused, don't worry. Much like autism, gender is a spectrum. Because I'm AFAB, I was raised as a girl, so my symptoms (of autism) closesly match those of adult women on the spectrum. All the info I found on autism assumed that you're AMAB (Assigned Male at Birth) and follow steretypical behaviour.\r\n\r\nAs a young child I got very good at masking my behaviour and also had crippling anxiety (hereditary GAD which combined with my dysphoria and autism). This meant that I was extremely quiet, shy and passive. To my teachers I was the perfect student. I never felt fully comfortable around other children and always felt like an outsider looking in. \r\n\r\nI found the book Women and Girls with Autism Spectrum Disorder by Sarah Hendrickx to be extremely useful, though part of me is sad that I couldn't find an adequate book on trans/non-binary people who have autism.\r\n\r\nEver since I realised I'm autistic my self-confidence has boosted massively.

I have been woken up to hear my things being thrown across the floor and the wall. I know these moments well. I always keep a pair of headphones on my bed. I put cardbord walls around my bed(its a bunkbed type thing). Ive done everything to tell myself it will be okay and i still can feel myself fall into the same husk I turn into everytime this happens. I go still and I shut the fuck up because I cant draw attention to myself \r\nI have to stay in a 1 bedroom apartment with her. Until im 18 or until she dies. The only place \'safe\' in here is the bathroom because i can lock it and pull out the drawers. Its the only bathroom though so it aplyfiys everything. After the night it got so bad i slept in the tub. I\'ve tryed to remain in the bed instead.\r\nI know that its normal. I know there has to be people who can relate but god i feel so alone. I want so baddly to talk about it. I owe my dad to stay so I dont want to go to authoritys but while the environment wasnt great. And the neglect would go as far as my mother drugging me to go to sleep for long periods of time. It was better than haveing almost every action be coated in fear. From the way i wash dishes to me hiding food and saving it. Ive been living with her since I was in 5th grade. It took till 8th grade to get adjusted but god. Its almost horrifying staying over at other peoples houses because it makes me realise just how much that happens is not okay. When i tell people about how mornings go they have this look that they give me. \r\nSometimes its good, great even. These times are spares and I am uneasy enough she can almost tell. \r\nThere are times when its okay. We dont talk. We just get on with our lives trying to ignore eachother as often as possible. \r\nAnd then there are times where I curl up and cry as quiet as I can while covering my ears and i shut off. \r\nAnd then there are times where i have to leave and have a surprise sleep over at someone else\'s house because I\'m genuinely scared for my life. \r\n\r\nMy dad isnt much better when he is around her. Ive woken up to him choking her. I woke up to my dad tearing down my cardbord window to go to choke me. He always stops. Even when I was little and I pulled his hair. He only left bruises on my arms but they didnt hurt much. My grandma has broken a lot of things here. A clay art peice I got as a gift. My closet, our vacuum, the light that\'s shattered. Even the floor has started peeling up and has dents in it. She also broke my laptop after going through it. It\'s almost everyother day where i have to hope that it will be over soon. I have caught her watching me at the foot of my bed. And i just. She has been homophobic and transphobic\r\nAnd have said some very racist things. She doesnt joke and if she does its not the offensive funny humour some of my friends do. There has not been a single person that wasnt my grandpa or my uncle that she has spoken foundly about.  I hear a lot of ""your schools are teaching you garbage"" and a lot of insults to me. I wont say them because all of them genuinely hurt. I felt shame to eat in public for a long time due to how her words truely hurt. \r\n\r\nEveryday i question if its abuse. Everyday i tell myself that its so close. Im so close to being 18 it will be okay. Im constantly faced with that once my dad ditches, which is something he said he was going to do(at the longest he would stay would be after i complete highschool) that I\'m going to be homeless. I\'m trying to figure out if I can support myself if I had sleep overs with friends. I am faced with genuinely worring about if anyone could take a box of my stuff and i know that im going to be a parasite to my friends but hopefully and i know someday I\'ll be able to pay them back. But God i hate this. I hate not having places to run to and being stuck here with someone who I fear so much. Thanks so much to corona for that. At least school got me out of the house for most of the day. \r\n\r\nI just. I\'m so sick of being here. For the first time in my life I\'m not suicidal. For the first time i actually care about myself. Its strange to actually be scared that I could die. I actually got upset at the person who hit me when I was biking. And that\'s all because of my friends giving me hope that I\'m not who she says i am. I am sick of living here. But its the only place that ive lived in all my life. \r\n\r\nI have starting calling my best friend\'s and my boyfriend\'s house home on accident.

It\'s seriously hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that the game was shipped with the problem, even more so that it persists a year after its release.\n\nDoes T10 just not understand UX? Have they ever played a game? Or is the most vital part of a game to them is how ""alive"" the world feels? \n\nNevermind that AI racers obviously materializing out of the facking mist is completely unimmersive and lazy, so the ""alive"" world has not been accomplished at all. If I\'m driving through a drift zone over and over again to do the damn thing, stop spawning fucking AI INSIDE THE ZONE! Did they even playtest their game? \n\nAdd this on top of the other absurd issues like the inexcusable instability and AI racing dirty at high levels and randomized level up rewards and you get yourself a game that really makes you ask the questions I do so lividly. \n\nThis is <ITALIC> simple shit. That\'s the biggest problem. They already have to have code that figures out where the player is and determines where to put Drivatars based on what you can see, so they could take the extra day of work to not impede the player with their obliviously spawned AI. This is an absolutely minor piece of code that would contribute MASSIVELY to the overall enjoyment of this game.\n\nThe PR stunts around the map should be rewarding and, to a healthy degree, challenging - NOT exasperating, <ITALIC> especially when it could have been remedied with a few days of work. Function over form, guys. I don\'t give a shit how alive your world feels if when I\'m driving through it I\'m getting t-boned, or t-boning, an AI that\'s turning suddenly at 200 mph, or when I\'m trying to do the drift challenges YOU assigned me and am having to throw off my drift to compensate for the AI I literally fucking watched spawn on my minimap IN THE ZONE I\'M CURRENTLY DRIFTING IN GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AT TWICE MY CURRENT SPEED. \n\nHoly fuckin rant. I just don\'t understand how ""game designers"" can completely disregard simple tenets of UX at seemingly every turn. I mean, I do; money and deadlines, which is basically just money and money. At least just release a product you can be content with. I would not be okay with asking people to pay 60 fucking bucks <ITALIC> minimum (and then shovel more DLC at them and plug your own games! Is this the fucking mobile market?) if this was my product. Not even a little bit. Just unacceptable.\n\nIf FH4 is going to be anything like this, or even the smoking shit stack of FM7, then I\'m not even considering putting money towards that game til it\'s on a gargantuan sale.\n\nBecause I\'m a hypocrite I\'m still gonna play the game; when it\'s functional, it shreds any racing competition I\'ve ever seen or played. I just have to steer way the fuck clear of most of the PR stunts, until a Forzathon makes me endure some.

That's preference and that's really the end of that discussion.\n\nAs for battleships not being useful, they are not optimal in the game's current state, and that is a fact based in efficiency statistics and testing. I don't like it and I want to change it, so I got a mod to see if the targeting issues in the AI would help. I don't just play with naked corvettes, because that's outside of my preference, so I want to try to enjoy the real depth the game could have.

DocIchabod,"['Alright. Let me put my two cents in on three main points you seemed to bring up, as a non binary person with a trans ex gf and several others of non gender conforming identities as close friends. \r\n\r\n1. Annoying trans obsessed people\r\n\r\nSame thing as with people who hate “overly gay” gay people. They’re likely unable to express their identity anywhere else due to social pressure and assume you or wherever you two are at the time is a safe place to be openly trans. Plus, it is a big aspect of their life. Arguably bigger than others in the lgbt community because it deals with a physical and behavioral expression and not just romantic or sexual. They aren’t trying to be annoying, and the fact that they’re so expressive around you means they’re comfortable doing so. \r\n\r\n2. Kids on early hormone and surgery\r\n\r\nLet’s nip this in the bud right now, no one is suggesting minors get surgery. No one. No. One. It’s a fear tactic used by people who want the trans community to up and die, and I’m sorry you’ve been convinced of it. As for puberty blockers, while they are available to minors they only delay puberty. It isn’t a permanent restriction, just something to ease the dysphoria until they’re of legal age to make the transition themselves or with parental guidance. Yes they should have some level of psychological understanding before getting the blockers but you said yourself that a person knows inherently their full gender. They’d know as well as anyone.  \r\n\r\n3. Gender as a social construct\r\n\r\nIt is. It absolutely is. Other cultures have had concepts for gender neutral identities and trans identities and genderfluidity long before America was a thing and long before anyone had an issue with them. Gender itself is a spectrum. And while yes, trans people often fall into a binary due to brain structure, this is mostly a signal of how genetics end to sort themselves out. Very few things that are “gendered” traits are inherently assigned to that sex, and the few that are are broad and useless in the modern perception. What’s more, why would the complexity of a human brain be required to be 100% male or 100% female? Couldn’t it be a little of both? Couldn’t it be a bit changing and shifting, as a brain would be liable to do?\r\n\r\nIn short, I’m sorry you feel this way about other trans people. I’m sorry you seem to find vitriol against those who live their life and have no ill will towards you. I wish you the best, and I hope in the future you can talk to the other gender nonconforming people around you to get their perspective. There’s a lot of good people you seem to dismiss on little basis, and it’s a shame you’re cutting them out so easily.', 'I have been metagaming to help them so far.

Sexualising themselves, and being applauded for it.\n\nHow terrible. I’m not talking about normal things like bikini pictures with no sexual intent, which men will find a way to sexualise anyways just like nudist beaches and other normal things that aren’t sexual in nature ugh, but you know what I am talking about. “You’re so powerful, so confident, so brave”. Stop it. She’s trying to get validation from men and society on how hot she is, how sexy she looks because that’s what this culture is telling her to do.\n\nI don’t blame these young girls. It is easy to fall into the “objectifying and sexualising yourself = confidence” rhetoric as a teenager. I blame the people applauding it, and the system further perpetuating that notion. Ofcourse men will say it’s confidence, it gets their holy peepees up! All the praise for camgirls and pornstars also further perpetuates it. “A woman who sexualises herself = good and confident. If you say otherwise, you’re oppressive!”\n\nUhm no, F off. I think women should be able to breastfeed without being shamed or sexualised for it. I think women should be able to show skin without being shamed or sexualised over it or sexualising themselves. I think women should be able to go to nudist beaches without being sexualised. I think young women should be able to show skin if they want, without feeling like they have to do it in an objectifying way.\n\nGirls should be taught to be great. To be intelligent. To study.

Nah. There’s not just these two options. The patriarchy told you that. Both these options are trying to control women, our bodies and sexualities, and both these options are beneficial to men. “Either cover up because we want to control women’s bodies and sexualities, or don’t cover up and please our gaze!!!” Nope!

I enjoy reading NDEs and it makes me wonder about the spiritual, and conclude even further my personal beliefs.\n\nHowever, I just smoked some weed. I am high. I decided to check this sub for any new stories etc, and a thought randomly popped into my mind.\n\nWe, modern humans, experience NDEs. There we meet this energy, this love, this light; God. Once up on a time, as far as we can use time for this example, there was a moment where we (I believe so) decided to fall upon this planet to learn lessons, good and bad. And to learn love.\nAnd this light and shared entities (like the old man with the white beard and a robe saves people, several NDEs have described this man. He’s not any religious figure, so it’s too strange to call it a indoctrination, and it can’t be a coincidence)\nThese entities are perceived by us to “our level” , these NDEs talk about lessons, evil, love, learned lessons, etc..All things that we also know and discuss in our lives. It’s not a foreign concept to our understanding.\n\nBut what if we go millions of years back? Back then we weren’t as advanced, and things like learned lessons and love weren’t talked about. We couldn’t talk like we do now. We just hunted, had sex and died.\n\nSo my question, and Ofcourse nobody can answer any questions like this about life, so ofcourse we’re talking about personal opinions. How did we perceive god back then? Did the Neanderthal have NDEs? How did those look like, and why? What was there to learn? What lessons and what love? And how did we advance throughout the years, together with GOD? Was that “the plan”? Are we closer to god now, or back then? I personally think now. \n\nMy guess is that god is how we perceive god, and perceive ourselves. Not how god is. Comparable how Christians are likely to see Jesus and Muslims see Muhammad etc. But on a bigger scale. So when we met god back then, we saw him in a form of our pretty primitive lives back then. As we advance, our vision of god when we meet him, advances as well, so we won’t just feel a feeling, but hear words and dialogue.\n\nAnother random thought I just had: maybe it is exactly that “light” that we felt when we died, is what pushed us humans to advance intellectually, socially and spiritually and get more “complicated” issues to resolve than what to hunt, and experience life in even deeper ways. \nFor example: we can feel heartbreak, we can do cool things like have friendships and swim etc, we have our human values that we believe in, we have a good bond with cats and dogs.,,,\nBack then it was more “simple”.\n\nLove to all.', 'All I’m saying is, go away, because western civilisation is nowhere near perfect and I will keep criticising it as much as I want.

Honestly, modern feminism has started to create a society where men are treated like garbage.  Feminism flies under the flag of equality when the real and obvious goal is domination.  My SO was a victim of this blatant attack on men.\n\nWithout too much detail, he went on a date in the past.  Things went well.  The chick liked him and things didn't go too far.  Long story short - The chicks friend was jealous because she had a crush on my SO.  Decided to falsely accuse him of raping the chick he went on a date with.  The college he was attending had to take it seriously and he was kicked off campus EVEN THOUGH his date flat out told them her friend was just being a jealous bitch.\n\nBut it doesn't matter.  He has a penis.

I hate it more than I hate anything else.\n\nNow to my point...  Men, if you present yourself in a message as your cock and only your cock NO WOMAN WILL RESPECT YOU.  I want to meet the mind and heart inside a guy, not his genitals.  My ex-husband had a VERY small situation but that's not what I saw in him.  I was married to him 5 years.  I was married to his heart, mind, hopes, and dreams for 5 years.  He only left me because we had a kid and that responsibility was too in the way for his music career.\n\nRegardless, my SO now has the most incredible soul and intellect.  Yet, in public he gets treated as a utility or a pretty face.  It drives me up the fucking wall.  Men are so much more than that.  You guys are SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.\n\n<BOLD> SO IN CLOSING, don't approach women as JUST your cock.  The women who respond positively to that are not the women you want.  Ironically enough, the women who give you shit for it are the women you're looking for.\n\n<HEADING> <SUMMARY>  The guys who PM chicks right out the gate with information about their dicks are setting back everything you're fighting for.

It\'s hell, but a daily is a daily.\n\n<ITALIC> Also, I have been playing since release and I have ONE cursed daily...  ""Leave with a new item.""  Any time I get this as a daily, I die EVERY time OR I get hit with franklin\'s while running out the exit...\n\n<ITALIC> A habit I have picked up is whenever I open a chest, I take the item to an exit gate and make a pile.  If someone with an item is sacrificed, I shuttle the item over to the gate and add it to MY PILE.  I have had, at maximum, a 6 item pile before.  My theory behind this is simply, if anyone needs anything it is all in the same place and god forbid someone else has my cursed daily, all the stuff is right there on your way out.  Also, if I have my cursed daily, I know where everything is so I can grab it on my way out.\n\n<ITALIC> But over the last few weeks, something amazing happened.\n\n<BOLD> First, there was a leatherface.  One sacrifice, one DC, five gens to go, ruin active...  I had already put two items in my pile and this leatherface took pity on my Nea and a random David and started farming.  I did gens and kept adding to the pile and when it came time to leave, leatherface saw my pile and took a screenshot.  Messaged me after and asked why.  I told him it was for anybody that needed it, and in the case of farming - I was giving David the pick of the loot.  Dude said that was super cool of me and we went on our merry way.\n\n<ITALIC> So...  We all know Legion needs some work.  However, I still have not won a round against him/her.  The second I pop into a round and saw a deep wounds timer, I started in on my pile.  \n\n<BOLD> With this first Legion - 4 item strong pile.  I\'m the last survivor.  Gens are done, gates are not open yet.  Remember Me is a thing.  I\'m being chased.  I decide to just run to my pile, blood puddles keeping him on my tail.  I crouch by the loot stash and he downs me.\n\nHe looks at me...  Takes a long look at my pile...  Spams the pick up and drop until I\'m on my feet...  Nods, hits the gate lever, I open it, and I leave.  Tried to message him but his messages are turned off.\n\n<BOLD> 3 hours later I encounter another Legion -  I\'m doing gens, unhooking, making my pile.  Comes down to just me.  Gens done, gates closed, Legion hovering between the gates and watching the hatch.  I go to the gate with my pile and pull the lever.\n\nLegion arrives, hits me once, I grab the lever again, he downs me...  Again, he takes a long look at my pile...  Pick-up/drop spam...  Lets me go.  Scoreboard pops up and it\'s the SAME GUY from before.  Message opens up in the corner of my screen.\n\nI quickly type, ""Nice to see you again.""\n\nHe responds, ""OMFG THAT WAS YOU!  Why are you leaving shit at the gate?""\n\nI say, ""In case anyone needs it, I\'m a nice person.""\n\nHe responds, ""I saw it as an offering, lol!  But that\'s great, you\'re doing god\'s work.  GG.""\n\n<BOLD> Rounds against The Spirit, Trapper, and Bing Bong...  They all see the pile, but still murder me.  <BOLD> Rounds against the Clown, he completely ignores the pile.  <BOLD> Billy is too busy NASCARing to care.\n\n<BOLD> But...  Third Legion - Sees my pile and there\'s still one person alive other than me.  I\'m slugged right on top of it and doing figure 8\'s between the items.  Legion leaves me and I\'m just gathering crows, trusting in the pile. \n\nShe sacrifices Laurie...  Comes back to me.  Picks me up and I don\'t wiggle.  Carries me to the hatch, drops me, and walks away.  I live.  Messages disabled for this killer as well.\n\nI keep testing it...  Surprisingly, <BOLD> Legions LOVE piles and show mercy to those who make them.  Running at about a 70% success rate with Pile Offerings to Legions between Rank 1 and 5.\n\n<BOLD> TL;DR - Don\'t DC against a Legion on PS4, just offer them a pile of items.\n\nEdit:  Words', ""Figured out our Killer's strategy and nobody seemed to understand how... \n I never play SWF.

Within 10-ish seconds I realize what's going on and message ONE survivor as fast as I can in short chunks so they don't have to leave the game screen to read it.\n\nThat survivor takes off and gets the last 2 totems RIGHT as the other two survivors finished the gens.\n\nWe all made it out...

The feeling of not fitting in, certainly hits home for me. I\'ve felt like that all my life, and I don\'t think it\'s going to change anytime soon.\r\n\r\nThe moments where I do feel like I fit in, are rare - and amazing because of that. It took me a long time to find friends that stay with me through thick and thin. If I had to categorize them, they wouldn\'t really fit in one group or identity.

I remember having this one dream as a kid where I went out into the backyard and there was a fairy/angel that offered to grant me a wish, and my wish was to become a girl. I continued to wear my sister\'s pajamas and whatnot every once in a while for the next few years. When I was around 11, I started staying up until everyone at my dad\'s house was asleep, and then grabbing a pair of panties and wearing them for a little while. I also found a couple transgender YouTubers (Princess Jules was my favorite) and watching videos about MtF surgery. After a week or so of getting away with wearing the panties in the middle of the night, I got a bit more bold and I started wearing my sister\'s dresses and even tried lip gloss. After a few days of doing this, my dad caught on. He waited for me to leave the room when I thought everyone was asleep, then once I had grabbed a dress and went to the bathroom to put it on, he sneaked into my sister\'s room (she wasn\'t in there) and waited for me to come back in. He caught me with the dress on, and basically said ""you aren\'t gay, why are you dressing in your sister\'s clothes?""\n\nAbout a week after this, we end up getting in an argument over something, I don\'t remember what, and it ends in him disowning me, ostensibly for crossdressing, or at least that\'s what he told my Mom.\n\nFor the next few years, until I was about 15, I completely stopped crossdressing. I was the most depressed I\'ve ever been, though I don\'t really think it had so much to do with the crossdressing as how much shit happened to me around that time. When I was 15/16, I started crossdressing again, being more careful this time than before. Again, I borrowed my sister\'s clothes. This time, I started with a pair of panties.\n\n<BOLD-ITALIC> (NSFW)\n\nAfter the pair of panties, I borrowed a one-piece swimsuit, and while I was laying on the bathroom floor (couldn\'t go to my room for some reason) I ended up masturbating in the swimsuit. This was my first time masturbating.\n\nI think this is where things got really confusing for me. I ended up only really being into anything sexual when I was in female clothing. I found the Sissy fetish, and it seemed to fit the bill pretty well. When I was 17, I finally got a girlfriend (had had some before, but nothing serious.) She was who I lost my virginity to. A few times, I tried to get her to dress me up, only once successfully doing it by having her \'dare\' me to try on a dress in the mall\'s dressing room. I also wore some cat ears and a little choker she had got, and wore one of her thongs once (she wasn\'t a fan of that.)\n\nHer and I ended up breaking it off, and a few days later I started dating my now-fiancee. I told her about my \'fetish\' up-front, and she was into it. After the first couple times, every time we had sex it was me being submissive and female. About a year and a half into our relationship, we ended up breaking up, and I went to a friend\'s house who I had confided in about my female side, and she took me to a party while I was crossdressed; it took so long to get my makeup done though that by the time we got there it was over. We ended up sitting there talking to the party host\'s wife (the host was a transgender woman herself) about random shit, and playing Cards Against Humanity while drinking tequila. She offered to refer to me as a girl if I preferred, but I told her that it didn\'t matter to me, because I wasn\'t really sure what I was myself. That night wasn\'t sexual for me, as I thought dressing up was always going to be, and that\'s where I started to have questions as to who I really was again.\n\n<BOLD-ITALIC> (End NSFW)\n\nFast forward, and my girlfriend and I are back together. I tell her that maybe this isn\'t all sexual, and she\'s again supportive. We\'re not able to really explore anything, so the extent of crossdressing I did was sexual still. About a month ago though, we moved into our own apartment. \n\nThe first week for me consisted of dressing up in female clothing basically whenever I had the chance. It felt good, and it wasn\'t all sexual, so I just kept going with it. About two weeks ago, I start realizing that there\'s certain parts of my body I really don\'t like. I don\'t like having hair on my body, I don\'t like when I can see a bulge from my penis, I don\'t like having acne or a distinctly male face, I don\'t like how when I gain weight it goes to my stomach, because it screws with my otherwise feminine figure. These feelings are normally really minor, maybe not even there sometimes, but when I\'m dressed up, all of them hit me. I feel like an impostor when I\'m dressed up, and sometimes it almost makes me not want to do it at all.\n\nThe most confusing part for me is that I don\'t really hate being a male, at least I don\'t think so. For work, I\'m dressed business casual every day and every once in a while I\'ll think that I look good. I love working on my car, and I don\'t mind people referring to me as male.\n\nI wonder if I have gender dysphoria or not, or if I\'m transgender or if this is just some weird other side of me. I think that if I had the opportunity to snap my fingers and never be a male in the first place, I\'d do it. But on the other hand, if I had the opportunity to not have these feelings of being something other than male, that if I could snap my fingers and none of this shit ever happened, I\'d do that too. There\'s so much going on in my head, and it\'s impossible to put it all down in a Reddit post. Hell, I don\'t even know if I know what all is going on up there.\n\n\n\n\n<BOLD> TL;DR  \nI have been crossdressing on and off as far back as I can remember. My dad disowned me for it, and I backed off for a little bit. When I started doing it again, I thought it was a fetish. Now that I have my own apartment and I can explore, I\'ve been dressing up more and it\'s not really sexual for me anymore. I don\'t hate my body when I\'m dressed as a male (i do have a feminine figure and no body hair due to shaving for what it\'s worth), but I really start to dislike my body and voice when I\'m dressed as a female.']",F

I want to be in my bed with fresh scars across my chest and just be able to think ‘I’m finally flat’. But I’m nowhere near there. I have a chest binder from a friend, and I want to wear it 24/7, but I know better than that.\r\n\r\nI mean, what is ONE night sleeping with a binder going to do? If it’s just one time, it can’t be that bad... right?\r\n\r\nIdfk. I honestly just want to disappear and never come back. I have to stay though, of course.\r\nTo cope other than self harming I’m thinking of writing a poem. Maybe I’ll share it here. That sounds nice.\r\n\r\nAnyways, y’all have a nice day. Y’all are lovely. ❤️', 'Pet rats in Brussels? \n (I posted this in <SUBREDDIT> but I thought it would be ok to post it here as well, hope that’s alright )\r\n\r\nHello! I’m possibly moving to Brussels in a few months (I’m with an embassy), but it depends on what happens with COVID-19. Either way, I’m moving in a few months and was wondering if it’s ok to own rats in Brussels.\r\n\r\nI’m planning on getting two fancy rats soon after I arrive, but I’m unsure of the laws.

It didn’t bleed that bad, but it still stung a bunch.\r\nI feel like I deserved it, but at the same time I have a feeling I didn’t. I cleaned it up in the shower with soap, hydrogen peroxide, and I put two bandaids to cover the long line of cuts up. (I cut on my hip/thigh) \r\nI’m so frustrated with myself. I stared at myself in the mirror after I did it, and I kept on thinking, ‘idiot. Idiot. Idiot’. I just hate the fact that the only way I cope is through self harm at this point. The problem isn’t even my fault. \r\nI can’t help the fact that I was born the way I am. (I’m ftm transgender but still in the closet) Honestly at this point taking scissors and giving myself top surgery has come across my mind every hour. I almost did it during a nervous breakdown yesterday. I don’t want to wait so many years to get top surgery, I really don’t. The only way I get my anger and frustration out at this point is cutting. \r\nThe first time I cut I didn’t feel guilty while doing it, but then I feel guilty afterwards so I do it again because I deserve it. It’s an endless cycle that I can’t stop. It’s frustrating. \r\nI might try venting like this more often. It feels sort of nice. I’ll look for some other subreddits I can vent on. \r\n\r\nAnyways, sorry for clogging up this subreddit with my useless chatter. I hope you have a nice day. ❤️', 'They are so pretty!

I wonder if some people aren't aware of it as I'm sure if you bring this up they will tell you otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nOnce somebody says no, it is not okay to keep on asking. Don't ask again. If your partner than at some point turns to you and initiates sex well, there you go but don't pressure them. Pressuring them, or making them feel pressured to have sex can lead to a lot of issues in relationships, they may find ways to avoid you, or when you mention sex they may lie and say they aren't feeling well in fear of if they tell you no that you'll just not listen. Communicate with your partner, don't pressure them.\n\n\n\n\nPorn I guess makes us think it's okay to be beaten, or degraded during sex. No, it is not okay. BDSM, DDLG, all of it is just bad. For specific topics I'll have a different post up by tomorrow. \n\n\n\n\nI think porn should be shut down, no more porn.

Why? Well, that's easy, they don't care. They list that person as weak and selfish. Some porn stars who leave porn are blackmailed into saying they just retired from it instead of telling the truth about their abuse, they have to keep up the lie that porn is empowering for women, when it's not.  Oh, and those who want to leave the porn industry? Yeah, they're also blackmailed. They are told that their families will find out what they're doing, or due to they need money they will make sure they can't get a job anywhere so they will be forced to stay in porn.\n\n\n\n\nPlease, if you decide to watch porn, don't. It's an abusive industry that condones rape, corrective rape of homosexuals, and trafficking."", 'I use an electric razor with the 3mm setting. It works really well and no cuts so far.

I hated being told I had to go hang with the girls, or be more ladylike, or do my hair/nails because others would be jealous and it was so pretty. I tried to fit in with girls a little more in high school only because I would get yelled at so much for being so boyish, and I was trying to fit in and be who my parents expected me to be. I definitely had some times were I felt ashamed of liking the way people called me sir in emails, or being boyish, especially when I was told that I had qualities other girls would kill for. \r\n\r\nNow I have to figure out how to come out.', 'I just turned 22 this past week and just started realizing it. I never considered gender in anyway at all growing up. I was a tomboy through and through growing up, all my friends were guys, I hated doing my nails or hair and I refused to wear “feminine” clothes. Found myself reinventing myself every time I moved (about 7 times) but usually always staying more androgynous. I did have long hair, I didn’t like shoulder length and was afraid to go shorter. My stepmom came into the picture and wanted me to be more feminine so I was (barely) and hated it. I cried when I got my first period and always tried to pretend I wasn’t really getting it. Tried to avoid wearing bras (other than sport) until my mom wouldn’t let me anymore in high school. I would pretend being a boy in my room, but stopped when I realized that probably wasn’t normal and repressed it until recently. Wore a lot of baggy clothes to hide my body. Eventually went through a phase of trying to get the perfect female form (never did and it’s ok). I got a boyfriend because I thought I needed to and I quickly realized he wanted a lot more than I did and I was very uncomfortable. But he made me feel I had to do things as a girlfriend (later I’d realize how shitty he was). We broke up and I went back to my baggy clothes. I’ve never dated anyone since. In college I stayed comfortable in my baggy clothes, joined an athletics team and became more sporty. Loved wearing suits for work. I dyed my hair purple, came out as aroace (may be because I can’t imagine myself with anyone as a female and don’t feel any attraction as I am now). Now I’m in grad school and living alone and been exploring myself more. Realized if I think of having sex I don’t want it as a girl, but want a penis. Realized I hated my chest and felt euphoric when I could get it mostly flat. Started telling my friends I was questioning and just felt right. Bought a bunch of men’s clothes and felt more comfortable than ever. Finally, yesterday I cut my hair off (all of it, it’s nearly buzzed on the sides and longer on top) and everyone noticed how much happier and more comfortable I immediately felt in my own skin. \r\n\r\nSorry this was long.', 'This is how I have felt my entire life but I had never realized it was dysphoria until last year. Now I’m trying to find a way to come out to my family after 22 years of them thinking that I’m someone else. \r\n\r\nThat person in the mirror was never me, the eyes were all I could see sometimes. My body was just my way to get around and sometimes when it was going through large crowds I’d completely check out, and all of a sudden realize later that I was somewhere else, kind of like when you’re driving and you don’t remember the turns you took but you ended up where you were supposed to. I thought losing weight and dressing different would bring connection but it tended to just make it worse. Standing in front of the mirror trying to convince myself that I was “beautiful” and that there was nothing wrong with me. Now I can see who I am a little better, and he is easy to see as “handsome” but sometimes I still slip back. \r\n\r\nDysphoria makes me depressed and anxious, and it’s hard for people to understand which makes it hard to cope with sometimes. My friends try to help by telling me I look good but on days when I can only see “her”, their words don’t do much to help. \r\n\r\nThis is the best I can explain it.', 'I’m starting to wonder the same about my asexuality.']",M

The way his eyes burn into you, how you can feel them bore into your head. How he can manipulate my heart. How he can tell and scream and then get deathly quiet when he gets angriest. How he must stares at you while you cry and demands your eyes on him. How he jerks your head up to demand eye contact. How he'll throw your head aside as though in disgust.

Shes always been better at sports and on varsity teams. \r\n\r\nThat only stopped when the divorce started. And now suddenly, I'm better just because she likes to smoke weed and see her boyfriend.

Pronouns never used to bother me but now that I’ve started coming out she/her/hers almost hurt to hear, but my voice is too high to not out me sadly. For me a lot of subreddits have helped such as <SUBREDDIT>, <SUBREDDIT>, <SUBREDDIT> (name?) and similar. I know my biggest worry is that I wasn’t obvious enough when I was younger and people will think I’m faking or it’s a phase, but people on these subs have been great and you can find all kinds of experiences there. Also, if you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to message me. I’ll answer as fast as possible (this week is really the only time it’ll be hard and that’s just because of not being out to family).

isee4lights,"['True story of how someone successfully dealt with a mission on their resume \n I am now married to a wonderful NeverMo. We live in an area of the country outside of Morridor but where there are enough members of the church that everyone knows of it.  The first time I went to a dinner with my now husband\'s extended relatives they found out I was a Mormon and his cousin, a successful businessman, told everyone in the room this story:\n\n“You\'re a Mormon?  Wow!  I have to tell you a funny thing that happened at work. We were interviewing people for a management position.  It was down to a few highly qualified people.  So this one guy came in for a second round of interviews and we asked him, \'Tell us why you think you would be the best at this job if we hired you?\'  He looked at us and with a huge grin said, \'Well, for one thing, if you look closely at my resume you\'ll see that because of my upbringing I once spent two years of my life successfully selling the Mormon religion door to door. Believe me when I tell you, if I could find a way to succeed at that, there is no challenge I can\'t conquer!\'""  My husband\'s cousin said everyone in the conference room, including the interviewee, burst out laughing and partially because of that answer the candidate really stood out among other equally qualified people and they decided to hire him.  The cousin then said, “Yeah, we all LOVE that guy. One of our best hires ever.”\n\nI thought this was a brilliant way to handle a situation I\'ve seen discussed here a lot.  I also thought that the way the guy answered the question was pretty clever because you can\'t really tell whether he was still a believer or had become an unbeliever, so it was inoffensive to both religious and non-religious people.\n\nIt also illustrates something I have learned – that people usually reflect whatever attitude I have back to me.  I used to dread running into members of the ward because it was usually really awkward.  Then I made a conscious decision to take charge of the situation.  Whenever I see someone from the church in public now I don\'t wait for them to see me or wait for them to react.  I immediately put a huge smile on my face and go right up to them, give them a big hug, and say, “It\'s so fun to bump into you!  I hope everything is going well!  Please say a big hi to everyone for me!”  I make sure I act confident and not apologetic or hesitant at all.  This has made a HUGE difference. (Obviously, the big hug doesn\'t pertain right now with the coronavirus stuff going on.)  I don\'t feel awkward anymore, and everyone has always responded really positively.  And the truth is that I do really care about them so I\'m being honest.\n\nTLDR:  The RM brought up his mission confidently, casually, and humorously in an interview and got the job.  This story confirms my opinion that we don\'t owe anyone, members or nonmembers, apologies for the path our life has taken and that confidence and good humor will usually win the day.', ""🎶 Everybody look left.

For a little backstory I’m non-binary and transitioning and I felt like my dead name (trans terminology for birth name that you don’t use anymore) was dragging behind me; so I decided that I needed to part with my dead name in order to move forward with my new name. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Here's the link to the original post as there are so many great suggestions that might be what aligns with your needs better if you're interested! \r\n\r\n<LINK>/\r\n\r\nI’m gonna talk about how I prepared first but will put a “**” symbol where I actually talk about the ritual if that’s all you want to read. \r\n\r\nI ended up incorporating a bunch of ideas together to come up with what I ended up doing. BUT FIRST I wanted to say that I didn’t actually do any sort of ritual until about two months later, and I didn’t plan on doing the ritual the day I did it, I just woke up and I knew that I was ready. The two months before I actually did the ritual, I started going by my new name (Leo!) and came to all the supportive people in my life and asked them to use that for me including they/them pronouns. I still felt my dead name clinging to my identity, I didn’t realize it until selkigirl mentioned it, but I’m pretty sure it was dysphoria. So for me the first step was coming into my new name, creating more space for myself to really fit into the idea and essence that I really identified with in the name Leo, and slowly yet unknowingly created less space for my dead name to have a place in my life. not sure if that sentence made sense but yeah lol. \r\n\r\nI also took a recommendation from another user (can’t remember who it was but if you’re reading this THANK YOU SO SO MUCH) to write my dead name on a piece of paper and try to make it beautiful, it was kind of like exposure therapy in a way, but it helped me realize that I did have negative feelings for my dead name and also let me see it and appreciate it in a “you aren’t my name anymore, but that doesn’t mean I have to hate you” kind of way. I meditated on how I wanted to feel when I would be called my new name, and I actually used a crystal to meditate on this with and literally two or three days later it vanished from existence, which for me means that the crystal has served its purpose. That was really encouraging for me and helped me solidify the bond I created with my new name. \r\n\r\nI won’t lie, I didn’t meditate on a regular basis, but I did when it felt right and that was enough for me. \r\n\r\n** So, to talk about the actual ritual!! It was actually really nice for me. I did this on May 22nd, which was a new/dark moon in gemini. For me gemini represents rapid change and that energy along with the dark moon energy was super strong and hopeful and I knew I was ready. First I cleansed myself with some deep breathing and a little palo santo. Then I took a white strip of cloth, long enough to tie around my wrist, and wrote my new name on it. I also took the piece of paper that had my beautified dead name on it, left the soon-to-be name tag/strip of cloth on the desk in my room, and headed outside. Since I live in a city it wasn’t pitch black or perfectly silent, but I looked into the dark-moon-sky and I FELT silent. It was really peaceful and beautiful. It felt like the entire world was in the universes womb. I listened to some Tibetan singing bowl tracks on Spotify and just meditated standing up. I imagined myself as a baby, just floating around, not having any name or label or gender forced on me, not identifying as anything other than a pure, un-stained soul. \r\n\r\nAlthough I probably should have done this before imagining myself as a unnamed being, I next took the piece of paper with my dead name on it, and started reflecting on it. Thanking it for getting me to where I am, and really really being thankful for it. I made sure to make it clear that the only thing I was releasing was the dead name, not any part of myself that it was attached to, as another person who reached out in my original post told me that their detachment from their old name was so effective they lost all their ID (thank you to you too!!!). Then I took the paper, thanked it out loud, then I burned it. I could have buried it or put it in a jar, but burning it felt like the most effective way to symbolize that it held no power over me anymore. \r\n\r\nFor me this was all I had to do to feel like I had released it, since I spent a good amount of time welcoming my new name and connecting to it, my dead name already felt insignificant and letting it go was relatively easy. \r\n\r\nAfter I went back to meditating on that feeling of not being labelled yet, I went back inside to take a bath. This was sort of suggested by someone as well, I can’t remember how much of this was their idea and how much was my own but if you suggested this thank you!!! I took a bath in the pitch dark and really put myself in that feeling of not being labelled, like an unborn baby. (Side note: I didn’t try to actually be a baby in the womb, but emulated that unlabelled feeling that Age regressing was not something that I did, but if it helps others cope then by all means go for it as long as you’re not hurting yourself or anyone else. Also idk if “unborn baby” is tone deaf but I mean this strictly in the terms of what feeling I was trying to feel. I support reproductive rights!) \r\n\r\nAfter the bath, I went to my room, and I tied the strip of cloth with my new name on it to my wrist and said “I claim this name for myself. It is done” and I went to bed. I wore the bracelet for three days straight afterwards. I’m gonna bury it on the full moon if it feels right :)\r\n\r\nI mentioned dysphoria at the beginning, wanted to clarify that even though I have released my dead name, I am still being called by it every day by family. So it still created dysphoria but the difference is now I don’t feel like it’s coming from myself, the dysphoria is coming from outer circumstances. It obviously isn’t great but I know in my heart that that is not my name anymore, it has definitely become easier to handle. I do hope my identity can be respected by my family at one point though. <BOLD> ** I’m also saying all of this for myself, what worked for me won’t work for everyone and this isn’t like the cure to dysphoria by any means!!! \r\n\r\nThank you so so much for everyone that helped, even if I didn’t use your suggestion the support alone was monumental I’ve never felt so supported in my life thank you thank you thank you.

The song’s lyrics again address the breakdown in Damon’s and Justine Frischmann’s relationship, but they serve to act as a final statement on the break up. Damon is ultimately not bitter, but rather wishes for Frischmann to find someone better who can give more of their time to her than Damon could. Damon later said “It upsets me, that song. It upset me singing it. Doing that vocal upset me greatly”.\r\n\r\nMusically the song is quiet and comforting, albeit retaining the dark finish of the rest of the album. Graham’s guitar playing is the main fixture of the song, and it perfectly matches the sad and resigned vocals from Damon. Graham also contributes some beautiful backing vocals, while Alex provides some nice bass work that intertwines well with Graham’s guitar work. Dave’s quiet and measured drumming also serves the song well.\r\n\r\nLyrical highlight: “I hope you're with someone who makes you feel, Safe when your sleeping tonight, I won't kill myself trying to stay in your life”\r\n\r\nMusical highlight: Guitar work, bass work\r\n\r\nBest performers: Damon, Graham and Alex\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>"", 'I’m able to listen to the deluxe edition of Familiar to Millions on Spotify.

freeslurpeeday97,"[""[PubQ] Query Critique - The Road to Peanut, Literary fiction/satire (55,000 words) \n   Here it is. Genre: literary fiction/satire.   \n\n\nI incorporate some mixed media in the book and I mentioned it briefly at the end. Also, the protagonist doesn't have a name. I chose to do so for my own personal reasons and to represent his identity crisis and how he bases so much of himself off of the past -- it's a choice that as the writer I have decided I cannot part with. Not sure if I need to handle it differently in the query. Thanks!\n\nAfter being arrested for vandalizing the local 7-Eleven as revenge for not receiving free-slurpees, the novel’s nameless, sentimental to a fault protagonist remembers that Peanut would have never been so lackadaisical about security cameras. Peanut, the narrator’s love interest and former best friend, had disappeared two months prior with her ex-boyfriend and his lo-fi indie band who “have done everything that The Beatles had only ever tried to do”. Her disappearance plagues the grief stricken, lovelorn protagonist who is consistently roped into shenanigans with his perpetually drunk Uncle Matt and his thrill-seeking best friend, Trevor. After Trevor convinces the protagonist that Peanut is his twin flame, a toxic spiritual concept that denotes someone is a person’s “other half” in which one person is the “chaser” and the other the “runner”, the trio hijacks an abandoned ice cream truck and travels to a post-industrial wasteland in upstate New York to find her. Along the way, they battle DIY indie music scenes, cannibalistic lumberjacks in dive bars, and estranged motel strangers in a series of humorous, satirical misadventures. Though when they arrive and meet Trevor’s friend Dustin, the three discover that the situation with Peanut’s ex-boyfriend is far more complicated than they had thought. Throughout his adventures, the protagonist learns to let go of lost love and to not chase someone who is running away. The humorous, coming-of-age satire that incorporates mixed media asks if the past has a place in one’s present, if these characters could be any more messed up, and how the hell an ear can be bitten off in a lumberjack bar more than once."", 'Should I drop out of grad school based on a ""gut feeling""? \n I (22F) am in my 1st semester of a teaching (7-12 English) graduate program.

And in a few weeks time, future you won’t remember the you now, either. \n\nThink about what you couldnt do only a year or two ago, like leave the house without panicking or showering at least once every couple of weeks (or maybe that’s where you’re at now, that’s totally okay too- this is just an example). \n\nAnd then realise where you are now, and see that you have survived all that- probably without even realising. \n\nOf course things will also get worse, that’s just the way life goes unfortunately. But you can look at the small victory’s you’ve already learned, and know that you can and will do it again. \n\nIt’ll show you just how much time does heal wounds, and that on the days you’ve done nothing, just by letting time pass, you’ve done something amazing. \n\nThat’s what I focused on :)\n\nI hope that helps!!\n\n\nPs sorry for such a slow reply, I really did reflect on this question', 'I know Im going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but honestly I really like her style.

B wouldn’t listen to me and wouldn’t stop which caused L to get all pissy and bring the argument it in the server (B had dmed L about how his vent wasn’t okay). another member, A, stepped in as well which caused even more problems. no one would listen to me when i begged them to stop. eventually B, my boyfriend, and A said if L wasn’t gone, they would go. then my boyfriend and i fought and he was going to break up with me if i didn’t ban L. eventually i just got so pissed and i banned L. i’ve had already unfriended him, and i’m sure he’s either leaving a review on the server or something worse. i then took a break after yelling at another staff member. i just had to get out of there and now i’m just wasting time to go back. i want to end myself, and i’m 100% in the wrong here. i am not the victim, i am 100% the evil guy and it’s all my fault. i pretty much most 3 people today and honestly i don’t know the point of going on. i don’t see why i’m valuable, and today has just solidified how much i ruined people’s lives. i’m so sick of starting over with new “friends” and knowing eventually i’ll ruin the relationships. i’m half considering ending it since i know my boyfriend, B, A, and L would be happier without me. \r\n\r\nsorry for the long post, i just needed to get this off my chest..', 'have you seen rylan today? i wanted to give them back their pen but i haven’t seen them since second period.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nhave you seen rylan today? i wanted to give him back his pen but i haven’t seen him since second period.']",M

Needing to degrade and abuse someone to get off is even worse. It is sexualised sexism, and romanticised abuse.', 'No, I don’t agree. Some kinks should be criticised, and especially if it’s a kink where women are being degraded and physically abused by men. Yeah there are women doms, and I believe they are also abusive. But majority of doms are men, and majority of subs are women. That’s how it’s normalised. You talk about how I’m kink shaming and that this is discrimination against kinksters, euhm okay, yes, and? I’m allowed to criticise normalised abuse and normalised abusers. “Just because you are vanilla” I used to be able to only get off to BDSM. Until I realised where those urges came from (I grew up in an abusive household) and I realised I am worth more than that. Other than that your comment is the typical kinkster argumentation, yeah consent blabla. Consent to abuse and to be abused should be criticised. Why do you want to be degraded and hurt to get off? Why do you want to degrade and hurt somebody to get off?', 'Only by saying “f that” to male validation, can women be free. \n I believe this is one of the major flaws of mainstream feminism, and also the reason why I chose radical feminism. If you look at modern feminism, it is still about pleasing the male gaze. Not at all about liberating women. It has partly(!!) liberated women from enforced gender roles, and rightly so, but the flaw is that it still chose to conform to the wants of men. I don’t know if “chose” is the right word but, either way the patriarchy found its way in.\n\nFor example when I look at a “feminist empowering” music video, it is so obvious still about looking appealing to men. Looking sexy. Looking feminine. Even if the woman is “in control”, it is still all about giving men what they want. A hot woman body to lay their gaze upon.\n\nIt has nothing to do with feminism. It isn’t liberating us. \n\n“Empower yourself” is the synonym for “look sexy”. For what? The male gaze.\n\n“Be in touch with your sexuality” is something I agree on. Except.. they twisted the meaning, and once again it only appeals to men. What it means is “look at what men find hot, and do that! Be a cool girl, care about their pleasure!”\n\nSexual liberation. While it is a good thing that we stepped away from “women need to stay virgins until marriage, otherwise they’re unworthy”. However, here the patriarchy also found a way in. Now it is “Aha. You don’t want to save yourself for our validation? Alright, now be a cool girl for our validation.” The normalisation of hookup culture benefits men. Not women.\n\n“Wear sexy clothes, even if they’re uncomfortable” for what? For the male gaze.\n\n“Shave your legs” for what? For the male gaze. \n\n“Sex work is empowering” For men it is. They benefit from it. For women it cannot be beneficial, even if it’s “ethical” porn. Selling the female body, sex, and consent cannot be “pro-women”.\n\n“Be a powerful sexually empowered woman” For who? For men.\n\nNow I’d like to be sexually empowered, however what they mean by it is “be a cool girl, please men”. That doesn’t induce any positive emotions in me.\n\n“Shave, wax, make your boobs bigger, your lips bigger, wear make up,...” For what? For the male gaze.\n\nThat is the message it spreads to young girls. They see sexualised women everywhere. On TV, on the internet, on social media, on billboards on the street, in movies.. everywhere. The message it send out is: “This is what looks good to the male gaze. Look how she attracts men. Don’t you want to fit in?”\nAnd young girls going into womanhood start to sexualise themselves, because they want to fit in. Shaving their natural body hair there is nothing wrong with, at a young age, because they want to fit in.\n\nMale validation is pushed onto women when they are still young. Only by criticising that bs and liberating ourselves from it, can we set a good example and truly be “pro women”.\n\nHow can ány of that be feminist? How can placing a woman’s value in how hot she is and how many men want to have sex with her, be considered feminist or pro-woman?\n\nShove that notion far up your ass.', 'Mmmm fuck yessss 😍And then put his little post-wall asshole to use 😈']",F

You have a huge majority against things such as this for either religious or generally conservative reasons.  Then you have a MUCH louder minority that says everyone should have the right to identify as a street lamp.\n\nIf we were to require counseling before a major transgender decision - It would be deemed insensitive and discriminatory.\n\nIf we were to ignore this entirely - You have a million confused children swapping genders like a pole vaulter and suffering mentally from the confusion.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that some people truly do feel like they are the wrong gender and more power to them in correcting their body to match their mind.\n\nBut as far as the wave of pressuring kids one way or the other as their parent or moreso riding this ""I\'m a unicorn"" fad-like wave of thought...  It needs to stop.\n\nExample:  I am bisexual (but male leaning).  My daughter has only ever seen me be in relationships with men like her father or the guys that followed after we split but she knows that I have been intimate with women.\n\nFor the LONGEST time I kind of got the feeling that she might be into girls.  However, I didn\'t acknowledge it out loud for a long time.

The next ten years of your life are crucial in figuring out who you are.  You can feel whatever way you want and you can claim an orientation whenever you want...  But maybe don\'t.

She comes home during the day to eat and nap and get love.  She\'ll sleep on the piano, behind the TV, in a dresser drawer, on the bed, sometimes she\'ll just plop down in the middle of the living room.  She loves being pet around her neck and on the head.

Behind me was the mistake I was escaping from and before me was an infinite stretch of possibility. My only reminder of where I came from was my Grandmother’s Jade pendant that hung on a delicate chain around my neck.\r\n\r\nThe train began its journey before I found my seat and my natural clumsiness made it a perilous endeavour. As my seat came into sight, I fell into another traveller accidentally as he distractedly left his seat.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with an insidious grin as he shook off my apology. Feeling a little creeped out I moved on quickly and sank gratefully into my seat. This move had no set destination and as the countryside flew by I contemplated everything that had led me to leaving so suddenly and with only the clothes on my back.\r\n\r\nMy family had disowned me and thrown me out onto the street, my only solace being that I had some savings in my back account from my gap year of work. I could not stand having an accidental meeting with people who had completely frozen me out of their lives, so I fled onto the first train out of the city.\r\n\r\nI was only 20 and not ready to be on my own, but it was better than pretending to not be who I am. Conforming to fit into the strict box’s others had constructed for me was suffocating and breaking free had been freeing, no matter the consequences. I could finally be true.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was ready to keep it a secret until I was ready to move out, but sometimes life has a funny way of forcing things out into the open. Walking into the kitchen on that fateful day everything had been normal until I bumped into a chair and knocked it over. Leaning over to stand it back up, my Grandmother’s pendant fell forward for all to see.\r\n\r\nShaking painful memories away, I reached up to fiddle with the pendant, a habit I had suppressed when hiding it at home. Only, it was not there. I touched my neck and patted my pockets, but it was missing, and I was beginning to panic. Ignoring the sway of the train I stood and made my way back through the car.\r\n\r\nSearching seemed fruitless as I made my whole way through and saw no peeks of green anywhere on the ground or any empty seats. As panic swept me up I had to conclude that someone had picked it up. I made my way through to see if I could find any staff that might have had lost property handed in.\r\n\r\nTrying to find my necklace felt like a huge joke from the universe at the expense of my search to find myself. Because figuring out who I was, was a long process of denial, discovery and panic. I was very much feeling similar feelings of denial and panic, I could only hope that I would soon make a discovery to end my torment.\r\n\r\nNot that discovering who I was had ended any torment, as knowing who I was had not made it easy to accept. Pushing the feelings back to my peripherals where they usually lurked, I moved on, only to bump into the same man I had when I boarded the train. Remembering how he had grinned at me, I had my suspicions that he might know where my necklace gone.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, have you seen a necklace? It has a jade green pendant on it. It was my Grandmother’s.” I asked him, mentally crossing my fingers.\r\n\r\nEmotions flashed across his face, proving to me that he had at least seen it once. I kept the panic from my face and tried to keep my familiar passive mask. The mask I had had to wear everyday since I had realised the truth.\r\n\r\n“I may have seen it. How about we sit together, and you can explain it to me more clearly.\r\n\r\nI was all but certain that he had it by this point and as much as I did not want to sit with him, I believed it was my only chance to see my treasured item again. Without talking I sank into the seat beside him and waited for him to speak. After everything I had endured, conversing with someone slightly creepy was easy.\r\n\r\n“Were you wearing this necklace when you got on the train?” the man asked as he reached forward and touched my neck as though to indicate where my pendant had sat.\r\n\r\nI nodded an affirmative as I leaned back to get away from his clammy hands. This whole situation made me uncomfortable and I fiddled with the hem of my dress to distract myself. My dress that I had bought just that morning after being kicked out.\r\n\r\n“Look, please just let me know if you have seen it. If not, I will see if it has been handed into the staff.” I stood up and prepared to walk away.\r\n\r\nHe grabbed my hand and a weight dropped, almost falling through my fingers. It was my Grandmother’s necklace, my security and the key to who I truly was. I looked up at the man, fury under the surface.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, I was going to give it back. I just wanted to have an excuse to talk to such a pretty girl.”\r\n\r\nMy anger melted away as I contemplated the man in front of me.

(kind of vent/soundboard, apologies for not being coherent) \n Hey so, uhhh, how do I start this\r\n\r\nI know that you guys can’t say what my gender is for me and etc, just kind of want a sounding board I guess.\r\n\r\nI have an appointment to get my letter for T in March (I would have liked to do it earlier but that was the earliest I could do). This means I had to come out to my parents again and they’re taking it hard. They are worried that I’m going to do permanent damage to myself, and they can’t imagine me as a guy. \r\n\r\nAccording to my mum I exude ‘female aura’ (she thinks it’s some past life stuff, I don’t believe in that kinda thing, but I’m happy to go to whatever spiritual/non spiritual therapy things if it puts her mind at ease). And my dad agrees that I’m not yknow ‘like a bloke’ in that I’m too nice about things, or can be too wishy washy and indecisive. I know I’m not the most manly man, and I am an over cautious sort. But am I too soft to be a dude? I don’t wanna be an asshole just to transition. I don’t think I need to, but am I too feminine? Or emotional? Or something? \r\n\r\nI do worry that I don’t have enough dysphoria, I get it every so often, once in a blue moon I guess. But also I’ve had a plan in the works, I have an appointment in march to sort this out, I don’t feel bad because as much as I’d like to have been on T yesterday, it’s 5 months, it’s reachable. I think I used to have more dysphoria, but god knows, I have such a shitty memory I don’t remember and it was probably just depression. I know I get euphoria, when I got new masc jeans and I look down and in my hoodie look like a guy, it makes me happy, I have decent enough shoulders for being afab, it’s not that I don’t like my body. I’d like my hips to be narrower, but I can’t do shit about that, yeah I’d like to be flat chested, but tbh I don’t mind my chest that much, it’s only a c cup you can barely see it. \r\n\r\nI think I disassociate a bunch also, it had actually been a while since I hadn’t recognised myself in the mirror, I don’t know how much that factors in, for both sides me being cis or trans. I don’t really have that much of a relationship with myself, or am aware of myself, I didn’t think I needed to tbh. It probably doesn’t help I’ve been having a bit of an identity crisis trying to find a name before I have to come out to more people with my last choice that I don’t like anymore. (I think I might go with Julian but i’d like peoples opinions close to me but I can’t talk to any of them about it)\r\n\r\nI’ve been identifying as some variation of not cis since 14, I’m 19 now, and I do think that’s enough for it not to be a phase. But I am still young, and that’s what worries my mum. Both my parents want me to try being a girl first, and to try a relationship because I don’t know myself until then. Mum says that she didn’t know herself til she was 20 and had her first relationship. I’d love a relationship, but I don’t see myself as a girl in it. I don’t wanna have sex because I don’t have a dick, but they won’t believe me til I do kind of conundrum. She says I seem like a cardboard cut out, and I do often feel like that, but she thinks it’s because I’m trying to be a guy and hide behind that, while I think the opposite (and just that I don’t seem to have any knowledge or hobbies tbh) \r\n\r\nI do want to go the full way, with T, top and bottom surgery. Change my name, just be a guy. And that’s what worries them, my dad says I can do that just don’t do the medical thing because I shouldn’t base it off what other people think (I see myself as a guy, I want T so people will take me serious and I pass (plus that sweet voice drop)).\r\n\r\nI guess my main worry is that I’ve convinced myself into it, that I learn’t about it too young. I worry that I’m doing it for the attention, to be special (in like a low-key way, to not be ‘ordinary’? Bc I don’t want people to like, acknowledge it). That I don’t understand what it is to be a proper man. That I don’t have enough dysphoria. That I have too many doubts. It’s all thrown me for a loop, I’m comfortable being trans, I always seem to come back to the same conclusion that I want all the procedures etc, but I just want to check in that I’m not just doing it to be stubborn? I mean no one wants to be wrong, but if that’s the case I’ll go back on it, not that I think I’m wrong though…\r\n\r\nAm I romanticising being trans? \r\n\r\nGod sorry this got long, I don’t have anyone to talk to this about really, so you guys get the big word vent."", 'If the x is on the edge like that sometimes its in the water under sand']",M

It\'s not a ""preference"" to want an equality wide spectrum of clothes to choose from. This isn\'t something based on what i prefer, this is something a game should do from the beginning. There\'s no reason for a game to treat male/more masculine players worse than female/more feminine players - not even if the game is hugely played by female/more feminine players. Sure, it\'s not as serious in a game like this - but treating minorities worse because ""they\'re the minority"" was never a good idea. \r\n\r\nI do however agree on the fact that they shouldn\'t make masculine clothes cheaper or more expensive than feminine clothes, just because they\'re more rare or something.

Ownard,"['Friend (19F) who rejected me (19M) genuinely thinks she hasn\'t - advice needed! \n Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI could use some advice on a situation of mine. \r\n\r\nRecently, I caught feelings for a close friend and expressed my feelings to her. She said that because of her antidepressants, she isn\'t able to feel emotions too well and wishes to stay friends until she can figure herself out. I took that as a soft rejection and proposed that we should take some time apart so that I can move on from my feelings and maybe we can be friends after that.\r\n\r\nHowever, things appeared to have gone differently than I had planned. Over the 2-3week period we weren\'t supposed to be talking, we each broke the silence occasionally, sometime by accident and sometimes on purpose. Recently however, she commented me on a Snapchat story of mine and we started talking. All of a sudden, she messages ""I miss you, when can we meet?""\r\n\r\nI was shocked at this and wanted to know why but I didn\'t have time to text and find out so I said we could talk later if she wanted to come over after my shift. Well, she didn\'t. So I was like ""cool, I set aside some time for you come and say your piece, but i don\'t want anymore bullshit, so please don\'t mess me about.""\r\n\r\nShe asked to meet the next day, I took some time to think and agreed, one of my friends said it would be better to have this talk in public incase she tries anything. We had a nice catch up then we had the talk. \r\n\r\nAccording to her, she didn\'t reject me. She just said that she was in a bad place and didn\'t want to get into anything. She said that right now, she misses me and wants me there to support her, that she broke up with the other guy she was seeing and didn\'t want to label us. This sent me into a bit of a mental tailspin so I kinda shut off and got defensive, insisting that it was a rejection and that while I care about her, I am doubtful of my ability to move on while being close friends. After some more emotional back and forth and going in circles, we agreed that now isn\'t the time for either of us to make decisions as she wasn\'t feeling great and I was stressed from work. I work in an emergency department.\r\n\r\nI think right now I do want to be friends with her, but I need to set the pretense that I am trying to move on from her, so there will be new boundaries and a bit more distance than before.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? I really think that she is an amazing woman, and if she wasn\'t in a dark place, she would be the perfect person for me to be with. I do want her in my life, but I am aware there are landmines, the main one being her depression.\r\n\r\nAny advice is appreciated!', 'I fell for a close friend, and now the friendship has ended, and I hate that it came to this. \n To start this, we are both 19. She is probably the person I trusted the most and we shared to much personal shit and were vunerable with each other so much. We grew really close and I enjoyed every minute of the time I had with her. She is an amazing woman and I would love to have her back into my life but I don\'t think that possible anymore.\r\n\r\nNaturally, over time I started to fall for her as we got really close. And I thought it was mutual. We started hugging all the time, hanging out at each others, holding hands, hell, she even slept with me(no sex) on Halloween rather than get a taxi home. I really thought things were pointing that we could start dating. But she could tell something was up with me and kept pressuring me until I confessed. At first she was shocked, and told me that she doesn\'t want a relationship right now but despite that she wanted me in her life and still be close. \r\n\r\nI took this as a rejection and said that I\'m going to need time to process my feelings and start moving on before we can be friends again. I just don\'t think it can be healthy when one party wants more than the other is willing to give. She said okay and that was that. \r\n\r\nFast forward a week and she asks if we can meet up because she misses me and is going through a hard time and needs me. I agree to meeting for coffee so I still have an escape if I need. Turns out, while I\'ve been away she spiraled down into depression and got worse. I told her that I am here if she needs me but I\'d prefer if she leaves that to emergencies because I am moving on. She asked why and I replied that because she rejected me, I need to deal with my unrequited feelings before we can be true friends. She proceeded to tell me that it wasn\'t a rejection, that she didn\'t want to label us and why can\'t we just go with the flow. She gave me hope and that was my mistake.\r\n\r\nI met her again a couple days later because I she was having a breakdown and came to me for help, so I went to help. I also went over because I had something I wanted to talk to someone I trust about. However, once it was solved and the conversation evolved, it became clear that I had hot my hopes up for nothing. I slept on it and decided to message her: ""I needed to do my own thing for a while, I\'m sorry if you feel I have wasted your time but I need to get over you before we can be friends"".\r\n\r\nShe blew up at this and had a meltdown. She blamed me for being selfish and being childish because I didn\'t get what I wanted. I realized she didn\'t care about me. She didn\'t take into account me while she melting down.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I regret the way this whole situation played out. I wanted to say that I just needed a break but she took it out the ballpark. I wanted to be able to be friends once I sorted my feeling out but that doesn\'t seem possible.\r\n\r\nI\'m thinking about sending a Christmas card to her once the dust settles in the hopes that maybe when we are more mature, maybe we can be friends then.', 'I agree.

If you're not really aiming to use it for a gauntlet or something where you need to win consecutively as much as possible (e.g. KC Cup Stage 2), and would rather respond to opposing matchups with more tech options, then running 1 and packing an extra tech card is fine.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, even with the feared brick hand, it's still possible to summon Ametrix and survive a turn then hopefully draw into Sulfefnir/Recycler the next (summon Thystvern, destroy itself to summon Citree; next turn, use Citree's effect pulling Thystvern and make Ametrix).

I’m a couple hours away from being officially 365 days away from the weirdest, most unexpected day of my life. May 27th, 2019. I feel like weird is an understatement but honestly that’s what it was. I didn’t know that I was gonna try what I did that day. Essentially I tried suffocating myself but it didn’t work but I feel the need to go into more detail since I haven’t really thought about everything that happened in those couple hours and everything that lead up to that moment. I was probably dealing with some pretty bad depression and anxiety/possible ptsd from living in a unique family situation for a couple years prior to this point, but I don’t think I ever got as hopeless as I did for about year before I attempted. I was also self harming almost daily for that year as well. At some point during the actual ‘attempt day’ this sudden wave of almost determination and realization washed over me, it was so weird. I KNEW I was going to die that day (obviously I didn’t actually know but I really felt so sure of it). It felt like destiny except that word has a good connotation. I tried seeing myself Alive and doing literally ANYTHING even a few hours later and I just couldn’t. I tried calling a hotline but I got put on hold lol. It sucked back then but looking back on it it’s a little funny to me now, I guess I laugh at it cause it makes it easier to process. I just remember crying so hard because I was in so much pain and I remember whispering “I don’t want to die” over and over again while I was crying. I’m not much of a crier but the tears were just pouring out and I had to silently sob because my family was on the other side of the bedroom door. I didn’t write any notes because everytime I did that I’d end up changing my mind and I really didn’t want to change my mind anymore. I just wanted to go. I might have been self-harming when I realized that I didn’t want to wait for things to get better anymore, I wasn’t tired of the pain as much I was tired of just plain living, no matter how good or bad life could have been. I kind of realized how stupid self harming was, if I hated my life I should just end it right? My brain has kind of erased a portion of that day from my memory so I really have no idea how I calmed down from it but I remember lying on my floor staring at my ceiling fan and just pretending I was dead, trying to strangle myself with a bathrobe string, I was really close I think but my head would get really tingly and I’d start going a little unconscious and I just couldn’t physically finish myself off. Like I said, no idea how I calmed down but I eventually just ended up going out of my room in a haze and I’m pretty sure I ate carrots and then my dad started interrogating me because my eyes were red from crying and he thought I was high. My dad isn’t the best and it didn’t help to get yelled at minutes after I just tried dying. Things didn’t get better until probably three months later. Overall, it’s safe to say that I’m in a much better place than I was a year ago. I met my current girlfriend, I discovered my own spirituality, I feel like my life turned around. I absolutely still have my lows, actually I’m sort of having a low right now, but my “happiness baseline” as I like to think of it is so much higher. The last two weeks leading up to today have been rough, I’ve felt a lot of emotions. I regret doing it but I also regret not dying while at the same time I’m so happy to be alive. I feel a lot of guilt for being so willing to leave everyone in my life behind, because I know there’s people that give a fuck about me. I feel guilty for not being grateful enough for my life. I wasn’t able to get professional help because 1 - shitty health insurance and 2 - my father has an untreated mental illness himself and refuses to let me see a therapist. It sucks but that’s the way it is for me and trust me I’ve thought of everything. It’s okay though because luckily I was able to pull myself back up but I do wish that I didn’t have to do it alone. To be honest I’m a little hurt that the people who know Th at I attempted haven’t said anything but maybe they think it’s a touchy subject, plus that’s a bit selfish and attention seeking of me so I’m not holding any grudges. Despite everything, I am really happy to be alive right now, even though things could be better. I’m about 9.5 months clean from self harm so that’s good! There’s a lot of things I have to be proud of myself for so I’m gonna try and focus on that. I just wanted to make this   to actually face the events of that day and share it and see if anyone actually reads this. Don’t want anyone to worry about me though, I’m honestly really okay now.

TheGirlOnTheCorner,"['My mom slapped me and I really just need to talk about it. \n I didn\'t really know where else to post this. I just kinda wanted to shout into the void and what deeper, darker void exists than this? \r\n\r\nMy mom suffers from anxiety and depression, as do I, and sometimes she has immense difficulty controlling her emotions due to it. \r\n\r\nShe\'s always been emotionally abusive and around the time I turned thirteen, things started getting physical. She wouldn\'t hit me, though. She always seemed to test her limits to ensure I wouldn\'t tell anyone, especially my dad. \r\n\r\nIt started with just throwing things. I still remember the first time. I can\'t even remember what we were arguing about, all I remember is a metal can of cooking spray flying at my head. Every time I entered the kitchen from that day onward, I saw that scene in my head. \r\n\r\nThis went on for a while. She would throw things at the dogs or at my dad, but never at me when my dad was around. \r\n\r\nOne time in particular, I remember her throwing one of those little plastic containers of gum at the ground and it opened and spilled out everywhere and she made me get down on my knees and pick it all up while she screamed at me. And when I say screamed, I mean fucking animalistic screaming. Half the time it wasn\'t even coherent. \r\n\r\nIt went on like this for a while. She would throw things or slam things around or every once in a while she\'d shove me. \r\n\r\nI remember the first time she actually hurt me. I think we were arguing about the fact that I had contacted my brother (he\'s a drug addict and not welcome in our family) and that I had a secret girlfriend (I\'m a lesbian and my mother is very homophobic). \r\n\r\nIn fact, quick side-rant about my coming out. I came out first to my mom. I didn\'t know she was homophobic as we\'d never really talked about it. I thought she would be accepting. Well, clearly that wasn\'t the case. \r\n\r\nI begged for months to tell my dad the truth, so maybe he could protect me, but she just kept saying it was too much too soon and I needed to give it time. \r\n\r\nSo, now we\'re in the middle of this massive fight and she finds out about my girlfriend and outs me to my dad. For months, I\'d been waiting for this special moment where I could finally tell him what had been on my mind for so long and she stole it away. That may not seem like a big deal to some, but for those of you that have had to come out, I\'m sure you can understand how special that moment is. \r\n\r\nAnyways, back to the story. It was the night before my fourteenth birthday. She woke me up around eleven o\'clock at night (I guess she couldn\'t sleep and decided if she had to suffer, so did I) and just started screaming at me. She started poking me in the forehead as she screamed ""WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP"" but, well, as I rationalised it to myself, her hand slipped and she kinda lightly punched me in the face. I tried to tell myself it was an accident, and I even believed that, but now I\'m not so sure. \r\n\r\nA few months go by and then we have my first suicide attempt. Since it was in a public setting, the police were called, CPS got involved, and I was hospitalised.\r\n\r\nQuick backstory, I got in trouble at school for having razor blades. I was self harming and the time and hates leaving home without them. When they called my parents to tell them, I started to have a panic attack, locked myself in the bathroom, and slit my wrists. I was terrified of what my mother would do if she found out I was self harming. She already thought I was faking my depression for attention. I could only imagine she would say the same of this. \r\n\r\nSo, after CPS got involved, my mother decided to get her act together. She even went to a couple of therapy sessions and for maybe a year, everything was okay. \r\n\r\nSometimes, in a major fight, she would grab my wrists or smack my arm or something of the sort. Nothing abusive, per say, just terrifying. And, just as before, she would threaten to beat me. \r\n\r\nThe emotional abuse began spirally out of control again in ways I can\'t even describe. With her, it\'s not just name calling or yelling. It\'s forcing me to dedicate my life to her, getting angry when I leave to do homework, and heaven forbid I want to spend time with friends. She tells me it\'s selfish to want to go to college or to be gay or to not want kids. She gaslights me, makes me doubt everything, think I\'m going insane. She tells me I can\'t trust my dad, tells me lies about him and makes me feel all alone, like she\'s the only person I can trust. \r\n\r\nAnd then, last night. Last night was the first time she really hit me. There were no excuses, no ""maybe her hand slipped."" She hit me because she was angry. \r\n\r\nMy parents had left me home alone for the night and told me to do my homework. As I mentioned previously, I suffer from depression, one of the side effects of which is fatigue. I am constantly exhausted beyond words. So, I fell asleep before I got a chance to do my homework. \r\n\r\nJust for reference, I am an honours student, all A\'s and B\'s. I always do my work. I just happened to fall asleep tonight. \r\n\r\nMy parents came home right as I was waking up. I lied and said I had done most of it and just needed to finish up, but my mom was fucking livid. I don\'t even really know why, but she was shaking with anger. We were supposed to spend the night together, but I just needed twenty minutes to do some work and then we could watch a movie. \r\n\r\nShe went crazy. Just starts screaming at the top of her lungs. Starts kicking my school computer (it\'s the only working laptop I have and if she breaks it I\'m totally fucked since most of my school work is digital and replacements cost like $200). Starts kicking the walls. At one point, she grabs my backpack and slams it into the ground. \r\n\r\nI shouted ""don\'t touch my shit""  as I have school work and headphones and all sorts of important/expensive/fragile shit in there that I don\'t want her breaking. \r\n\r\nShe raised her hand and I cowered back and covered my face. She just stared at me for a while, like she was sizing me up, wondering if she could get away with it. \r\n\r\nAnd then she slapped me. \r\n\r\nIt didn\'t hurt since I was hiding behind my hands, but it terrified me to my core. I went into a full blown panic attack. \r\n\r\nAfter maybe fifteen more minutes of screaming, I finally get a chance to talk to my dad alone. I\'ve never really talked to him about the extent of her...whatever this is. I\'m in hysterics, sobbing, begging him to help me, to get me out of here, to do something. \r\n\r\nHe told me it was my fault for falling asleep. And that hurt so much fucking worse than anything my mom could\'ve done. \r\n\r\nI love and trust my dad. I thought he would protect me. I thought I was his world. \r\n\r\nHe told my mom what I said and she, of course, denied it. Called me a liar and said I was just looking for pity. Said God was watching and He was disappointed. \r\n\r\nThe last thing my dad said before they both left was that his parents hit him and he turned out fine. That a slap wasn\'t abuse and I should just get over it and get my act together. \r\n\r\nI know it wasn\'t abuse. I know one slap is nothing and I should just get over it. But it\'s everything. Every little string she pulls. We are her marionettes. \r\n\r\nI just turned sixteen. I don\'t know how to get through two more years of the gaslighting and screaming and threatening. I just want to be done. \r\n\r\nI\'m sorry for the rant. I just needed to let this all our so I could finally get some sleep without all these thoughts clouding my brain.', 'THIS.

You might already know some or all of this, but just in case.  \n\n\nThe short version: Men face just as much women, and typically face the same issues as women do with some noteable exceptions. The only major difference however is just how swept under the rug these issues are.  \n\n\n<BOLD-ITALIC> Disclaimer: This does not invalidate, nor lessen the issues women face. All I\'m doing is pointing out that that men and women are two sides of the same coin, and thus face many of the same problems and just don\'t realize it.  \n\n\nContrary to popular belief, the media embelishes mens bodies just as much as it embelishes womens bodies. Every Men\'s Fashion magazine, Men\'s Exercise Magazine, every late night infomercial about <BOLD> MAX GAIN\'S <BOLD-ITALIC> EXTREME <BOLD> WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM AND SUPER-NUTRITIONAL WEY-PROTEIN POWDER COMBO INSURES THAT YOU\'LL LOSE THAT SPARE TIRE YOUR WIFE MAKES FUN OF AND GET THOSE <BOLD-ITALIC> EXTREME <BOLD> GAINS YOU\'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT that\'s really just snake oil effects men just as much as every photoshopped womens fashion magazine, models that are destroying their bodies just to keep their jobs, every <ITALIC> In this weeks issue of You\'re not a Good Enough Woman, here\'s 20 tips to shrink that waist-line that\'s based completely on the current trending psuedo-science that may have lasting, potentially dangerous effects along with romance tips from an Actress who\'s been married 6 times in the last two years! effects women.  \n\n\nBut in a truly awe-inspiring act of contradictory logic, many people, men and women alike, use same Toxic Masculinity logic of ""It doesn\'t effect men the same way it effects women. Women already have such terrible self-confidence issues."" which not only harms men, but infantilizes women. Men are human too, and constantly being told and being given examples of how you aren\'t good enough is going to make men have confidence issues just as much as it will women.  \n\n\nIt\'s the same with compliments. Women compliment each other <ITALIC> so much, but for men, compliments are few and far between. You go onto any post asking men about compliments and 95% of them will tell you that they cherish ALL compliments because they\'re so, so rare. It\'s like we\'ve been conditioned that woman constantly need to be validated, while men are supposed to assume that people recognize they did a good job, or look good, or did the right thing.  \n\n\nAnd then there\'s the <BOLD-ITALIC> REALLY touchy subject. Bodily Autonomy. Men exist in this weird super-position of have too much, and not enough bodily autonomy. On one end, women are almost universally allowed to hit, smack, or otherwise touch men with little to no recourse. A woman grabs your crouch on the bus or subway? Wow! You\'re one lucky fella! A man squeezes a womans butt on the bus or subway? If the woman speaks up, chances are he\'ll either be beat up (rightfully,) or arrested (rightfully,) or both (again, rightfully so.)   \n\n\nOn the other end, it\'s almost like men are made to make up for womens lack of bodily autonomy, which can be down-right terrifying. If a man and a women both get drunk, and in said inebriated state, decide to have sex with each other, neither can legally give consent, however, in such a case, the man is at an objective disadvantage. If the women decides that because she was drunk, and could not consent to sex, constituting rape, there is very little chance of the man being able to successfully fend off such accusations, despite that fact that he was also equally inebriated. What this means is that a man is, basically by law, required to keep his head while being under the influence of alcohol while a woman is not when it comes to drunk sex.  \n\n\nAnd again, I\'d like to point out <BOLD-ITALIC> THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT WOMEN DON\'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH TERRIBLE INEQUALITIES IN SOCIETY!!! All this post is doing is pointing out some of the inequalities that men face. This issue is that most people pose this argument too simply. This is not a two-platform scale where if one party is suffering, the other party is prospering. We live in a multifaceted society where both parties have benefits and deficits, mean of the same nature. However, one parties deficits are almost systematically ignored in leu of their benefits, and the other parties benefits are systematically ignored in leu of their deficits. And the most infuriating part of that is that the more extreme people from both parties work day and night to cover up the others deficits and benefits! Some men work tirelessly to make sure that women are seen as the lesser sex, and don\'t deserve the same treatments as men. And Some women work without break to make sure that men\'s issues are never even addressed, let alone fixed.   \n\n\nTL;DR Both sexes have a lot of the same issues, but people don\'t seem to notice that.  \n\n\nP.S. Sorry for the long post. I just personally feel really strongly about fairness, and any time I see anything that isn\'t fair, for men or women, I just get really heated. It\'s something my mother drilled into me as a child.', ""I think the reason it's not there yet is because of two reasons. \n\nThe first is that things like this necessarily take time. You have to think about how long drug tests go on for, and then probably double, or maybe even triple it since this is quite literally about changing someone's very DNA. Scientists and Ethics committees are going to want to make extra super duper sure that this method is safe.\n\nThe second reason is sadly there just isn't really a huge market on Trans effecting science. Even in the article itself, the effect this could have on the trans community is a secondary thought, an add on. I haven't exactly looked into the history of SRS, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was simply an after thought of doctors while figuring out how to reconstruct genitals of CIS people, but I could be wrong.\n\nLuckily! That will hopefully change! As time goes on, Transness is accepted more and more, and as that happens, more and more trans people will be able to make trans effecting discoveries that will help others!\n\nWho knows, maybe even one of our lovely trans redditors will be the very person to push this science through to human use!

She’s always been cold. At the time it was me and my older sister, she didn’t interact with us much at all.  I moved in with my dad at age 11, she divorced about a year later after having two sons with him. After that our relationship started to get better, I visited her every other week.\r\n\r\njump forward a bit, i’m 18 and I don’t live with either of my parents. My mom is super involved in my brothers’ lives and cares about them deeply. She’s not the mother I grew up with, she’s much much better. The problem is that though she’s improved and stepped up for my brothers, she has a habit of forgetting I exist. \r\n\r\nFor the last few years I’ve had the issue of not being invited to things the rest of my siblings are. This means traditions like thanksgiving and christmas. It’s an ongoing issue, she isn’t intentionally not inviting me (at least it seems that way) but legit does not think about me. This is believable for her, if you knew her you’d understand. \r\n\r\nIn march this year I came out as trans, but i don’t think she’s used my name once and she and the rest of that family use the wring pronouns, which doesn’t aggravate me too much because I barely see them. But she had a few times where I saw her refer to my brother as her oldest son. \r\n\r\nA few weeks ago I saw on facebook that her and all my siblings went on vacation together. This includes my sister who doesnt live with her and has her own child. I knew nothing about it. \r\n\r\nI wasn’t invited to my step brother’s wedding (she remarried, my new stepdad is great) and for reference this isn’t a traditional wedding, Around where I live it’s less formal so you invite whole families more than individual people, I didn’t know it was coming up, I just saw the pictures.\r\n\r\nI never hear from her, I message her every few months, sometimes to check in and sometimes with a question in mind. I try to organize dinner together or a visit. I am the only one putting any effort in and over the past year that’s slowed down a lot. I thought if I stopped trying it wouldn’t bother me as much but I honestly hurt more. Seeing my brother’s being adored and their pictures flood her social media makes me resentful. I don’t blame them and i’m glad they get to have a mother but why couldn’t I? I can understand growth and regret but she makes no  attempt to fix what she messed up with me, just seems to like her new start and people who aren’t still suffering from her actions or lack of in the past.\r\n\r\nI know I sound a bit emotional but it’s hard to distance myself when typing this up. I want to stop hurting. I think a way to do that is to finally cut that cord, remove her from my social media, stop checking in. The problem being that despite how little we talk, She’s the only one I talk to on that side of the family. I’m afraid to loose people including her. Are her sins enough to banish her from my life?

dream1ng-1n-c0l0ur,"['I think there is something dark going on at my uni and I don\'t know if I want to look into it \n So a few days back something really strange happened. Really, I have never believed in the supernatural or monsters or anything before. But now I am scared and I think you guys know better what to do.\r\n\r\nSo two weeks back me and my friends found ourselves having 4 hours of free time in the middle of our lecture day. We decided to watch some Netflix and went to look for an empty room. In such a big university your be surprised how difficult it is to find an unoccupied room.\r\nWe looked for a really long time, when we ended up debating just watching mute with captions. But then we found a door to a stairway. \r\n\r\nI didn\'t prior know it existed at all but apparently in the one new building we have an extra flight of stairs that nobody ever uses. <ITALIC> And I sure know why now\r\nBut for our occasion it was perfect. Noone interrupted us, we weren\'t annoying anyone, we just had this whole thing for ourselves and enjoyed some avatar the last airbender.\r\n\r\nAfter our laptop ran out of charge and we still had some time on our hands before we had to leave for our next lectures we decided to see where the staircase leads. We went down two flights and it stopped.\r\nBy the time I had come down there one of my friends had already found the metal door under the stairs. I was still joking ""oh look we found the cubboard under the stairs"". \r\nBut he was really nervous and wanted to leave.\r\n\r\n ""Don\'t you wanna check it out?"" I asked, still mostly joking but also curious. \r\n""Definitely not. Let\'s go""\r\n\r\nSo we left and I mostly thought the story to be over. Yes we found a wierd flight of stairs that is kinda locked off from the building and there is a metal door underneath it. But so what?\r\n\r\nBut this week I returned to the staircase room. I was having a panic attack and I needed a place to be alone and wind down. I stayed at the top of the stairs for about and hour until I felt ready to go back to my friends. But then I remembered the door. And this time I was too curious to resist. There was noone holding me back. I just wanted to take a quick look in. It was probably locked anyways right? <ITALIC> If it had only been locked...\r\n\r\nSo I went down and under the stairs. There was no lock in the door. Just a metal door nob. It was so cold to the touch that I could only grab it after pulling my sleeve over my hand. Why didn\'t this stop me?\r\n\r\nI pulled at the door and it opened slowly but surely. The cold that came out if the room made me shiver. It was dark inside. But every two seconds there was a very faint glow from further inside. \r\n""Hello?"" - Silence.\r\n\r\nI took my phone and turned the flashlight on. The room was empty. The dark concrete walls had stains all over them but it was impossible to say what from. The floor seemed wet. There were no sounds. I looked around to try and make out what had caused the light and across the room there was something on the floor. I couldn\'t make out what it was but it wasn\'t further than 5 meters away from me.\r\n\r\nSo I looked around me, made sure noone was there and that the door wasn\'t closing on its own. Then I ran in the room, picked up the object and ran out again. It might have taken 6 seconds. But the cold was scary intense. I still get shivers right now just thinking about it.\r\n\r\nBack out of the room I looked at what I had picked up; a phone. Its screen was completely shattered, making it difficult to even read the message that had been lighting up the screen: ""no signal""\r\nI swiped over the screen and to my surprise it unlocked. The homescreen showed two girls and a dog. I didn\'t recognise them but then again the screen was shattered. \r\nI opened the messenger app. I wanted to find out whom this phone belonged to and if I could bring it back. The top chat was titled ""babe<3"" and had one unsent message. A voice message. I pressed play\r\n\r\n""Hey, umm, I\'m at our staircase, you know, I needed some time to think. And since you aren\'t here today I thought I\'d bring you here per voice message. And, umm, I know you didn\'t wanna open this door, so I thought I\'m just gonna do it now. So you don\'t have to be here but you\'re kinda here, you know. So here we go.\r\nUh fuck this is cold. Ah. Ah. Better. Okay. You ready?\r\nSo surprise it\'s dark as heck in here. And cold.

I really want to find out what happened to her but I\'m afraid it\'s already way to late and I\'d only end up the same way she did.\r\n\r\nI wish I had taken the phone with me but in my rising panic I let go of it, it feel on the ground in the room, I closed the door and ran. I ran to the toilet to calm myself down once again that day.\r\nI haven\'t set foot in the staircase room again since. I wanted to get the phone, to get in touch with Chloe, find out what happened. But I couldn\'t bring myself to do it yet.\r\n\r\nAm I a bad person for knowing this but not doing anything? I have to go back and get that phone. I am so scared; the scream, the cold...

The main deck cards are all HOPT, do next to nothing when it comes to interacting with/disrupting your opponent, and are not splashable into other decks. The Synchros, namely Quariongandrax and Ametrix, aren't particularly busted either as they only banish 3 and switch monsters to defense, respectively. Even if they're <ITALIC> kinda generic, you still don't see them run in every other Synchro deck due to how tight the ED is. While the deck as a whole is seeing some representation in the ladder, they aren't particularly dominating nor make up a huge chunk of the player base.\r\n\r\nAs for the more likely targets:\r\n\r\n* The other Synchros, like Black Rose, Samurai Destroyer, Inzektron, Dolphin, etc.: I also doubt any of them will get hit as they aren't absolutely broken. However, even if they were to get hit, considering the lowest a card has ever gone to was only Limited, it'd make no difference as you only run 1 of each anyway.\r\n\r\n* The Skills: Transcendent Crystals is actually the most possible target for a nerf, especially since it's seeing additional rise in Black Salvo decks for the GY setup. I still don't think it'll get hit because you do need to run 2 Garnets that usually do not synergize with the deck at all to use it, unlike a certain other Skill that completely shuts down several decks for the measly cost of a Cosmic Cyclone, which can actually result in advantage if you banish an opponent's backrow. Even if it did get hit, there's still the SSA variant, and I'm sure there'll be other ways to work around it since we have Undine.\r\n\r\nI don't think there's anything wrong with waiting as you don't have much to lose if you're really unsure. You can always hold onto your Gems for the new box in case you find something else there you want even more, and if you don't, then that's when you go all-in with Crystrons. For the most part, though, as long as new Synchros keep coming out, Crystrons can indirectly get better."", ""Undine is usually run in the SSA variant since it can dump Citadel Whale in addition to the Crystron monsters, making SSA more searchable.\r\n\r\nWith Rion at 2 now, Controller <ITALIC> might be more useful now as the LV3 Tuner you use for Synchro plays during your turn so you can conserve your Rions. Mid-to-late game, assuming Sulfefnir's in the GY, Crystrons don't really need their Normal Summon anyway, so summoning Controller shouldn't be a huge problem."", ""Three is ideal, but 2 Sulfefnirs should be enough to get started. It should be good enough for casual or climbing up to Platinum/Legend in my opinion, but for the most part, you'll likely need the 3rd copy if you're aiming for KoG.\r\n\r\nI assume you're using the SSA variant since you're planning to use Undine, and for that, 2 Undines and 1 Controller should also be workable. You might wanna run an extra Citadel Whale temporarily, though, but it's not super necessary.\r\n\r\nIn either case, I'd suggest running a smaller deck to compensate for the slightly lowered consistency, but you can also choose some good staple/tech cards to disrupt your opponent instead to buy you time until you do draw them.\r\n\r\nAnother workaround is to play the Heavy Starter build with Machina Fortress; Fortress can make for a decent sub-boss that can also keep you alive until you do draw/mill Sulfefnir.""]",M

Y'all know whats up!"", 'Some advice I just gave to a fellow single mother on FB who posted a long rant about her ""baby daddy""... Figured I\'d also pass it along here. \n <BOLD> Context:  She posted a long, detailed rant about how much she hates her ex and why she hates her ex (mostly because he is a shit father who isn\'t around much) and I recognized my past self in her post.  Decided to tell her some things I\'ve figured out in my time as a single mother...\n\n<BOLD-ITALIC> <ITALIC> <BOLD-ITALIC> <BOLD-ITALIC> <BOLD> _\n\n<BOLD> My response to her post:\n\nUgh... Wow. If this isn\'t me years ago I don\'t know what is. I used to be angry and hateful and bitter towards my ex because of ALL the reasons you have listed here. The plight of a single mother is a rough story to tell and there\'s a lot of emotion behind it. But, I\'d like to offer you my experience and what I\'ve learned and how I\'ve grown because I see my past self in this post...\n\nFirst off, know this: Yes, you are your child\'s hero. She may not show you appreciation for it yet, but she\'s still a toddler. She\'s not ready or mentally equipped to understand who is putting more work into her right now. For her, as a toddler, the world is sunshine and unicorns and everyone in this world, including your ex, is merely there to make her smile... But she WILL get older. She WILL start to grasp the inequality in parenting here. \n\nFor example, my daughter went for a visit with my ex two years ago when she was 6. During that visit my ex and his girlfriend were driving somewhere with my daughter in the back seat. They had a car accident. A mostly minor one, but it was scary for my daughter and it bruised her up a bit. Do you know what my ex told me? When they crashed and she was hurt, even though she had her Dad RIGHT THERE, she cried for me. She wanted me to pick her up and save her and make her all better. Why? Because she had become old enough and mature enough to know Dad, who has been absent a lot in her life, wasn\'t her rock. Dad wasn\'t the parent that held her when she was sick or cared for her when she got injured. Dad didn\'t have the magic kisses for boo boos and Dad didn\'t know her favorite jokes and stories to calm her down... My daughter knew that I HAVE ALWAYS been the one to provide those things. She cried for ME.\n\nSo yes, you ARE your daughter\'s hero and though she may act like her Dad is still the greatest now, as she ages she\'ll understand and show that YOU are her parent. You are who she needs. He\'s just a nice little bonus that doesn\'t know what he\'s doing half the time due to lack of experience.\n\nSecondly, and this is going to sound really blunt: CALM DOWN! There came a time for me after quite a while of being a single mother that I realized the hate, the myspace and FB posts, the fights, the bitterness... It was all a waste of time and energy.\n\nFact of the matter is, he chose to leave. Maybe it was entirely his fault, maybe it was your fault, maybe it was both of you... But he has made his choice not to be with you or in your kid\'s life full time. Let me be the one to tell you, NO AMOUNT OF bitching and moaning or fighting or calling him out or stressed out tears is going to change that and it\'s all A WASTE OF EFFORT AND ENERGY. \n\nYou have been and are a single mom. Accept it, embrace it, let go of the hate and move forward. I\'m not saying this without fault here. You know the ""on this day"" function here on FB? I look at my old posts and there\'s always one or two from years ago EVERY DAY bitching about how my ex just wasn\'t in my daughter\'s life. You know what I do when I see those now that I\'ve grown and moved past all the anger? I cringe. I honestly can\'t believe how bitter and enraged I was over something that happens all the time in this world. Many fathers leave, it happens, there\'s reasons, and we as single mothers have to take on the new duty of accepting it and just doing the best we can without them. It\'s a lot of work, yes. It\'s a lot of self sacrifice, yes. But, God Damn It [NAME], take this opportunity to be the best mother you can be all on your own, let go of all the poisonous feelings, embrace your circumstances and just be SUPER MOM. \n\nYou know what will piss your ex off the most in years to come? It will piss him off when you obviously don\'t care about his choices anymore. It will piss him off that you accept the fact he made a losers and cowards choice. But what will piss him off above all, is that your kid LOVES her MOMMY MORE. That will be his fault, he\'ll come to that realization, and he\'ll be the one suffering because of it.\n\nAnother example from my situation... My ex has started trying to be more of a father now more than ever and my daughter is nearly 9. Why all of the sudden? I moved on from the hate, I ended up with a great guy, and (without my ex involved most of the time) us three here have a pretty happy family life. My ex sees that his daughter is having a great family life with a strong mother who has done everything and a father figure that is better than him and HE CAN\'T STAND IT. My ex and his girlfriend have suddenly demanded that they get my daughter for two weekends every month. Why? Because (and it took him a while) he finally realized HE could have had a kid that adores him and doesn\'t. He realized that HE could be having family meals and outings and doesn\'t. It took him years, but he realized that he fucked up, he\'s missing out, and now he\'s trying to make up for it...\n\nLet that time come. Let this time pass. Things will be easier and different if you just stop harboring hatred and anger and just accept that he will never fully step up to the plate and if he does, it will be too late because you succeeded in being the calm, rational, super parent that I know you really are. Your ex will realized his mistakes one day and try to change things. When that day comes you just get to sit back and laugh and laugh and laugh because his mistakes can\'t be erased. \n\nAnd my final thoughts: You know how people say, ""You just do you.""\n\nSeriously [NAME], JUST DO YOU. Be Mom, be [NAME]. Don\'t be ""hateful, bitter, enraged bitch"" because I chose to be that for a while and NOBODY liked me for it. Let it all go, accept the way it is, move forward, and JUST DO YOU. Who cares about your ex and his shitty choices? When someone asks where her Dad is the answer should be, ""He\'s not around much"" and that\'s it. People will know just from that how great YOU are and how shitty HE IS.\n\nAlright, I think I\'m done here. If I upset you in any way I truly apologize. I just know how agonizing your mind set is right now because I WAS THERE. Just please, either take what I said to heart or disregard it, but please remember... YOU are the hero here.

At one point, she\'s writing a conversation between herself, and her ""character"", which is the male version of herself she shows the world, because she can\'t let her secret get out. He\'s named Eddie, her deadname, the name everyone around her uses for her. Even though she\'s writing him, she finds Eddie to be cruel and conniving, and he verbally beats her down and calls her disgusting. She asks why, and he just says that this is the way all ""normal"" people are. That\'s why she has to hide it, because nobody would accept her for it. And, through him, she realizes, that if this wasn\'t the way she was, if she was just ""normal"", she\'d probably be transphobic, and treat anyone else in her situation the same way Eddie is treating her. Because, she <ITALIC> is Eddie. Eddie\'s the version of her that isn\'t trans. Eddie would have been raised to think people like her are disgusting and gross. So that\'s what she would probably believe, if she didn\'t have to go through it herself.\n\nSo, I guess my question is, do any of you think that if you weren\'t trans yourself, you\'d be transphobic? I\'ve heard of people being transphobic before they knew they were trans, but that might be based on an internal conflict with and rejection of their transness, so it\'s possible that they would have been <ITALIC> less transphobic had they been cis. Do you think this would be the case for you?\n\nTo answer my own question: no, I almost certainly would not be. My parents raised me very well, I\'ve been getting support from them, and they\'ve been teaching me about love and acceptance my whole life.\n\nBut don\'t be afraid to tell me if you think you would be.

I actually kind of like being so short because It fits my image of what I want to look like as a woman better. \n\nSo my question is this: If I was <ITALIC> really trans, wouldn't I have always liked being so short? Is this something other people have experienced, or is it not normal? Thanks!"", 'Thinking about transitioning, but no dysohoria \n This is kind of uncomfortable for me to post because I feel like I\'m stuck at a crossroads between transitional to female and maybe being happier, and staying as male and maybe getting over it in the future.\n\nI want to get right into it. I don\'t feel dysphoria, atleast not how I\'ve seen it described. I recognize that right now, I am male, my body is male, and my brain is male. This isn\'t a pot shot at people who think otherwise that have/are/will be transitioning: it just has nothing to do with me.\n\nThe reason I want to transition, or why I think I do anyway, is because I think I\'d be happier as a girl. For the past couple years whenever I saw a woman acting in a feminine way, even just the way they stand or look around, I get jealous. I realized I wanted to stand the way they do, to laugh and look and act like a woman. In those past couple years, I\'ve given up on being a masculine guysy guy because I figured I was just more effeminate than typical. Most of my friends are woman, I like cute things, etc, but I\'m still jealous. I want to have long hair and stand in cute ways.\n\nI know I keep coming back to the standing thing, and I know it\'s a small detail, but it\'s what made me initially realize I was interested in becoming a female, so I just keep coming back to it.\n\nBut I really don\'t think I\'m dysphoric. I don\'t think I\'m a woman trapped in a man\'s body. Again I have absolutely no problem if you do feel dysphoric in this way, it\'s just not what I feel about myself. I recognize that right now, I\'m a guy, but I think I\'d like to be a girl. It\'s a shame there\'s no trial or demo, haha.\n\nI\'ve thought about cross dressing before, because I think that\'s as close to a ""demo"" that I could get, but when I think of myself wearing the makeup and the clothes and a wig and staring into the mirror I don\'t think I\'ll like it. It feels wrong, but I\'m not really sure why I guess. I think it\'s because I still identify as a male, and so I don\'t want to see my male self dressed like a girl. (as an aside, I don\'t like seeing myself at all, but I think that\'s more of a self image problem)\n\nIve spent the last couple days looking at both <SUBREDDIT> and <SUBREDDIT>, because I like seeing both sides of it, and it honestly scares me. I understand that one sub is full of people who have had/are having happy experiences transitioning, and the other is full of people who are regretful, but its making me very nervous. Will I really be happy as a girl? Will I be OK with taking pills for the rest of my life? From stories on detrans I\'ve kinda decided against ever getting surgery, and I think I\'m kind of OK with that, if a bit let down.\n\n I really just wish I was born a girl. I wish I had my childhood as a girl, grown up as a girl, gone to high school as a girl, etc. Although I guess a lot of people want that, haha.\n\nI\'m any case I\'d really appreciate any insight on my situation, whether you\'re trans or not, supportive or not. I dont really feel comfortable talking about this to people I know irl, but I really really just want to talk to <ITALIC> someone about it. Thank you, and I\'m sorry of any of my comments felt offensive. I just want to say again that everything Ive said is about me, and I have absolutely nothing against the detrans or trans communities or people who have / have had gender dysphoria.\n\nTLDR: Not sure if I\'m dysphoric and I\'m scared of making the commitment.

This is not something you have to do or should feel pressured to do, but anyone who is feeling self conscious about how they look in a photo, take some time to google portrait photography posing techniques and diy lighting techniques.\n\nHere's a great example: <LINK>\n\n<BOLD> A photo is not the sum of who you are. It is a fraction of a second taken from one perspective. Be happy with yourself. You are beautiful. You are valid. You are a child of the universe, like the trees and stars, you deserve to be here. You are welcome and encouraged to share the best version of yourself.\n\nWhether that's slapping a filter over a photo that makes your eyes pop, using lighting, dodge and burn techniques, camera RAW adjustments, all or none of the above. Simply putting yourself out there and having the courage to do that, you'll always get my upvote.\n\nThank you for coming to my TEDxx Talk."", 'You always get downvoted in my comments babe \U0001f923', 'My wife complimented my fashion taste, saying she was going to steal this dress i bought for myself and wear it with a Jean jacket.

We had a lot of other party members come in and out, but for this story the only one who matters is our human cleric, let\'s call him Steve since I\'ve got a story about a game he GMed as well and I like having names for reoccurring characters.\r\n\r\nSo, first off Steve was the GM\'s son, which might be how he got away with some of the shit he pulled. He claimed to have read every book for 3e and 3.5 but never cited the sources for anything he used to my recollection. I know he had the Rebuke Undead ability and he had some feat or variant or something that allowed him to take control of undead he successfully rebukes with no apparent limit as to how many he can control. He almost instantly got 5 skeletons under his command and he eventually gave them bows, he later got a wraith and two undead minotaurs. He referred to this collection as ""The Army of Dorkness"". On top of all of that, he eventually got a spellcasting bear as a mount, so, already he can stomp things using just his army and mount.\r\n\r\nBut that isn\'t all, he also acquired some +2 full plate, a +2 tower shield, and a cloak of displacement, so, nothing can hit him and anything that does has a 50% chance to just not. Then he acquired what he referred to as a replica of Sauron\'s mace from the start of the first Lord of the Rings movie. It was a +3 large (he had monkey grip) that imposed a DC15 fort save to not be knocked back 10 feet and, weather you pass it or not, a DC15 ref save to not be knocked prone, as well as 1d6 damage of any type other than slashing, piercing and bludgeoning, which can be changed as a free action. I believe he also had winged sandals but the party collectively had like 4 pairs of the things so that wasn\'t too special.\r\n\r\nWith all of this (plus some suspiciously high stats and good rolls) he was already strong enough to fight the entire rest of the party and win, with some hit points to spare since he never multiclassed and so was still getting cleric levels, giving him plenty of wound curing. But that wasn\'t enough for him, he did some kind of ritual to become half fire elemental, dealing damage to anyone who came in physical contact, becoming immune to fire and gaining the ability to cast Fire Storm and Wall of Fire at least once each per day at his divine caster level. At that point the party were just an afterthought to him, he didn\'t need us and none of us were having fun since he would just singlehandedly steamroll everything.\r\n\r\n A few session after he became a fire elemental and promptly retouted the entire campaign to the elemental plane of fire for reasons I don\'t remember the GM got fed up with his shit and canned the campaign entirely.\r\n\r\nTL:DR: GM\'s son abuses rules and probly does some homebrew that he claims is legit and becomes so strong that the rest of the party are not needed, since the GM wasn\'t mean enough to the rest of us to build encounters only he could have any chance of handling.']",M

weezerwookie,"[""I bought solar panels, but I don't ever have a tax liability \n EDIT: Thank you all for educating me on taxes. I now see it is possible to take advantage of this tax credit for next year's tax season. I'm just gonna lower my 401k and flexible spending account contributions, and claim tax exempt to give myself a bigger pay check. I guess I can put that money to a Roth instead. I also expect a promotion very soon. With those three factors, it would give me a tax liability that this credit should wipe out when tax season comes around.\r\n\r\nOP: I feel like I may have been victimized by predatory sales and lending practices. The system cost about $25,000. I was sold on what I  thought would be a $7-$8,000 refund I would get in addition to the  $5-6,000 I normally get each year from the IRS.\r\n\r\nI bought the panels with a loan. The loan has an introductory period, where you  only pay on like $16,000 of the loan, and if you don't give them the $8k  within 18 months the loan goes up to the full amount, and the minimum payment goes up as well. That will make it so that my loan payments on the panels cost more than my electricity did before solar, so that makes going green a luxury for those who make much more money than I do.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm trying to figure out how to get that money. I've been thinking that maybe there's a way I could do my refund this year that would give me that additional rebate, but that would give me a tax liability next year that would be covered by the solar panel tax credit. However, I don't know how to do that without maybe committing fraud, which would get me in big trouble and possibly have to pay more, and maybe lose my job as well\r\n\r\nI'm a disabled war veteran.

Although Desvenlafaxine works alright \r\n\r\nI’m a super depressed individual, in just about every sense. It’s been about 3 years since it picked up hard, and about 1 and a 1/2 years since I’ve started being somewhat functional again. \r\n\r\nSo some background: I was on venlafaxine for 6 months after my previous medication, paroxetine, gave nasty side effects and didn’t work reliably. \r\n\r\nI’m going to condense/simplify this some, but here’s my explanation as to how and why it fucked me up so badly: So venlafaxine’s most active metabolite (little chemical bit that it makes) is called Desvenlafaxine, which causes the brain to think it’s making more serotonin (neurotransmitter that makes you feel ‘happiness’, etc) and norepinephrine (neurotransmitter that gives you energy) through various processes. However, in delivering it in a slightly different form it requires some enzymes in the host to do the work on changing it from Venlafaxine to that good-good Desvenlafaxine. \r\nHowever, I have this fun quirk about me where two of the enzymes partly involved in this funky transition (CYP2C9 and CYP3A4) have mutations in the genetic code that makes them. This means they’re garbage at their job, and instead the shit Venlafaxine makes does only about 50% of what it should be doing in my brain, and the other 50% goes off and causes <ITALIC> fuuuuuuuun side effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nI slept 15-20 hours a day, would be dream-like even after I woke up every morning to the point that I would turn off three alarms that required me to spin in circles to turn off and fall back asleep with no memory of the event. \r\nNot to mention the mood-swings, acne, increased overall depression and hopelessness.\r\n\r\nNo thank you kind sir, I have had my fill', ""AITA For getting away from my supportive family? (21M) \n Alright, so I love my family. They're incredibly supportive, and I'm beyond thankful to have them on my side. I have a big family, but my dad is financially stable enough that they have helped me pay for my college tuition. I'm on my last year of college, but they still provide me with money for my medicine (I have a disease that requires medication that costs 700$ a month) and in the past when I was at college without a job yet, they provided money for essentials while I was at school. I thank them almost daily for their kindness in this.\r\n\r\nTypically I'm either working away from home or at college working and studying. These past two weeks have been a bit of an in-between period. My summer job has ended, and I've been at home with my family. They recently moved, and as its a new locale for me I don't have a job in the area. I've been staying with them these past weeks doing my own thing, trying to enjoy my time off while helping out. I've been cleaning after myself and others, hanging out some with my parents, and try to play with my younger siblings for an hour to two hours a day. We also typically have dinners together daily.\r\n\r\nNow, while I love my family and am incredibly grateful, being in one place with them for the past few weeks has been hard. We've been under a lot of stress because of extended familial issues, and I feel they've been putting some of it onto me. The other day my sister (19, also home from college for the summer w/o a job) was trying to express how the summer has been hard for her due to her lack of ability to attend therapy. She did this by saying this hasn't been a good summer for her. My parents began yelling at her for this, telling her it isn't fair for her to complain when they've provided this much for her. When I stepped in to say that it was about her mental health and not about their actions towards her, they began to berate me as well. They said that I never want to be around them, never help them, am ungrateful, and don't think outside of myself.\r\n\r\nOne of the key facets of their argument was that daily my sister and I have been going to coffee out of the house daily or sleeping in. They called this laziness and trying to escape from them, and were deeply hurt. They don't see why we would want to get out of the house for a bit if they are supportive and loving, and while they allow us to go to coffee are continually offended when we tell them we are stepping out for a bit to this day. I still try to clean the house and do every task they ask me or mention to me without complaint, along with telling them daily I love them and am thankful for their providence. I don't hate them and try my best, but sometimes I just need a break from my family in the form of stepping out for a few hours.\r\n\r\nI don't want to be ungrateful. I understand that they do provide a lot for me.\r\n\r\nAITA here for wanting to get out for a bit or spending some time alone in my room each day?""]",M

They should have carved out a piece of Germany for a Jewish homeland after WW2, but they figured they could just push around Palestinian Arabs easier.

Under our leadership's command, we terrorized that country's civilian population and killed as many as 1 million Iraqis.

But the pilots and ammo loaders didn't make those decisions either.\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that all religions are right and all are wrong as well, they aren't necessary.

Also figured out he likes Sanders Sides too :)\r\n\r\nSo while I was out shopping with my Dad for Herbs at the local gtocery store we decided to get some Starbucks. My Dad can\'t survive without his coffee and I love tea to death. Specifically green tea lemomade with sweetener.\r\n\r\nI want to preface the story with this: I love my Dad. Zane appreciates my Dad a lot. He\'s a funny man with a good heart and he is determined and strong and the perfect role model for me. He just is very stubborn and is a strict Baptist Christian. \r\n\r\nSo after we get our drinks and make our normal jokes and comedy routine (we ham it up every day to make whoever we are interacting with smile in a sort of ""boomer humor"" style and I had been wanting to ask Zane about pronouns, as I saw his trans pride pin on his hat.\r\n\r\nSo as Dad was walking off I stoped and asked about pronouns. He said ""male"" so I confirmed by saying ""he/him."" Dad stopped and was super confused. I just repeat and say ""he/him pronouns."" Dad gets a look in his eye I normally see when he is upset. He is a veteran so you can imagine that it\'s a very scary look. I try to explain but he says two things that really stuck out like ""God gave you an outie or an innie"" ""We will just have to agree to disagree"" and ""Zane is a woman. She knows I love her."" And he does. He genuinely platonically loves everyone who works in that grocery store. We know almost the entire staff and we are both very social people.\r\n\r\nZane, the absolute fucking champion he is, takes it. I mouth to him ""I\'m sorry"" as we leave and he shrugs and moutsh back ""it\'s alright."" Zane, shoutout to you man. You are a fucking madlad and I look up to you for strength.\r\n\r\nWe get into the truck with our drinks and plants we bought and Dad brings it up again. Everything he says is just give him a confused look, both playing the naïve ignorant child and a polite disagreeance at the same time. Dad getd the hint and just says ""We can agree to disagree."" Honestly, he has come such a long way and I am proud of my Dad for being respectful in that scenario and not freaking out. He used to through around the f<BOLD> *t word a lot and now he\'s being polite and actually taking into considerstion feelings and beliefs of those around him.\r\n\r\nI was raised to respect others, as you would with a veteran father, so I explained to him ""I saw the pin and wanted to ask. I wanted to respect his pronouns."" In whcih he responds ""Good. I\'m glad you did that. I just don\'t agree with it."" Not the best, but this is a huge step forward for him.\r\n\r\nThen he asks me how I knew and if I indentify as male too and stuff, trying to get answers. I don\'t know how I didn\'t crack and admit that I am a trans man too, but I told him ""I just want to respect Zane\'s pronouns."" He nods and starts the truck. He didn\'t skip a beat in changing the subject to the herbs we bought and were going to plant on our drive home.\r\n\r\nI want to end this with two different statements reitersting what I said in the story.\r\n\r\n1.) Zane you are a fucking champion for taking that like a man and I have super respect for you 💚💚💚💚\r\n\r\n2.) My Dad is a good man. I do not hate him in the slightest. He is a very good man who raised me right. He\'s not perfect, but he is getting so much better. A huge reason why I\'m waiting until I am an adult and financially able to support myself to come out is because a.) He will think it\'s just a phase and take away my interner and queer friends, and b.) If I can give him proof (brain scans and similarities) as well as support myself if thet disown me and have shown them my entire plan and be logical about it, they might  believe me\r\n\r\nI wanted to share this story here because I know this is a wholesome community and I also wanted to give Zane some huge props for that. \r\n\r\nI hope y\'all won\'t be too mean to my Dad in the comments. He used to be completely intolerant, homophobic, transphobic, say slurs, etc. But He doesn\'t say the slurs a lot anymore and he learned to cope and move past his homophobia somewhat when my brother had a gay roommate.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this!\r\n\r\n<SUMMARY> My Dad was kinda transphobic to a Starbucks employee after I asked for his pronouns, but he learned to let it go and ""agree to disagree"" which is a huge improvement from his ideas/behavior before.', 'HUZAH, THE LOACH KING RETURNS!!!

It already happened"" and he laughed and said ""no it didn\'t"" \n\nI went to grab my phone, which I couldn\'t find.

DocIchabod,"['Let me preface this by saying I myself am on the spectrum. I have a personal stake in this. And I will also be responding to the concept of this being for the elimination of autism altogether, since while you didn’t claim to believe that you did pose a question towards it in the last paragraph. \r\n\r\nThat being said, you’re under a misassumption many people have that all autism is terrible and debilitating in equal amounts. It isn’t. It’s a bit of a twisting of the wires, a different way the person who has it perceives and expresses information. Some are nonverbal, some are very eloquent. Some have trouble with social or societal cues and some don’t. It’s a spectrum. \r\n\r\nAutism Speaks sees this condition, this state of mind that is not lethal and is not physically painful, and they see it as a detriment to the people who have to raise the children. They see it as something that is a curse, a horrible affront to all decency. They want to get rid of autism, not assist people who have it or support parents who have autistic kids. \r\n\r\nAutism isn’t exactly a blessing, but it isn’t a curse either. The curse is people who treat you like subhuman for being born different, for thinking and acting in ways that aren’t neurotypical but harm no one. I wouldn’t want to be born any other way, but according to this organization I should feel ashamed and horrified at my own existence. \r\n\r\nI am not broken, nor is anyone else with autism. Supporting us and finding ways to help in day to day life is a good thing. Wanting to remove us from existing is a bullshit way of saying you don’t like how we’re different so you want us gone. \r\n\r\nCancer kills people. Diabetes ruins lives.

Strike up a conversation at \\[insert context here\\]!""\r\n\r\nI can see where people are coming from when they give that advice, but in practice, I think it gets really warped and ultimately predatory. People stop reading basic social cues because they\'re so laser-focused on securing a date and end up being creepy and harassing people.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I want when I\'m just trying to exist as a human being in a public space is for someone to approach me with the intention of sizing me up as a dating prospect. Being attractive in public is not an invitation, I didn\'t opt in for this, and it makes me feel unsafe and incapable of enjoying myself. It\'s a shitty position to put someone in, and it\'s like no one even considers the other person\'s experience. To them, the worst-case scenario is they get rejected. Maybe they accept it gracefully and go about their business, or maybe they get pushy, or maybe they start moping at the bar ... whatever. No matter how it goes, the recipient of this unwanted advance is now most likely Fucking Uncomfortable for an extended period of time and may very well just pack up and leave because they can\'t enjoy themselves anymore.\r\n\r\nAt least with OLD, everyone has explicitly opted in to play the dating game and you\'re not fucking up someone\'s entire day by hitting on them when they 100% do not want you to.', 'I totally understand the burnout factor! Even though I\'m pansexual, I stopped trying to match with women because I got so frustrated with how little engagement I was able to get out of them on OLD. I think I got extra annoyed because I feel like queer women need to stick together, and then I started to get paranoid that they were all actually hetero women looking for an ego boost or just curious, or maybe they were catfishers or bots or whatever. Idk, it was just exhausting.\r\n\r\nIt\'s easy to get discouraged and lower your standards because you\'re sick of looking, sick of putting in effort and getting nothing back, you\'re lonely and/or horny, etc., but if the way you find someone to date is by lowering your standards to accept their undesirable qualities, you end up dating someone undesirable. I\'ve been there a few times and now can confidently say how deeply Not Worth It that is.\r\n\r\nYour expectations are, unequivocally, NOT too high. They\'re yours, and you have a right to them. I don\'t prescribe to the idea that ""there\'s someone for everyone,"" but I do believe that there are a lot of people out there who are not compatible options and unfortunately you have to swim through a sea of people who aren\'t for you to find the people who could be.\r\n\r\nI 100% believe that you make yourself less likely to find a good mate when you lower your standards, because those standards don\'t actually go away, and all the things about that person that are sub-ideal are still going to bother you, and you\'ll end up back on the fckn apps in 4 months anyway. Better to be as picky as you need to be and find ways to enjoy being single in the meantime, which can be easier said than done but is a worthwhile endeavor either way.\r\n\r\nI also believe that getting jaded and going half-assed on your approach to OLD is vastly inferior to just stepping away and taking a break if you need it. The right person for you out there is not half-assed and will not be attracted to half-assed. To find your person, both of you are gonna need to put in the entire ass. I don\'t believe the answer is to stoop to average. Eventually, you\'re going to send a message to someone who is impressed by your thoughtfulness and genuine, engaged approach, and they\'ll give the same level of engagement and interest back, and that\'s the goal.\r\n\r\ntl;dr - This stranger on the internet validates your expectations/standards and encourages you to be your best self even when other people are slacking.

I\'m not necessarily shy, but it\'s just I don\'t engage in a lot of small talk or gossip unless I\'m with close friends. I usually only get super chatty with strangers if they get me going about a subject I love. I\'m very laid back, a home-body really, I take care of my cat and put something on in the background like music or something to watch while I do chores or write. I want to write stories with deep and vast worlds such as LOTR or Marvel Comics that eventually gets turned into an adult cartoon. While I try to achieve that I want to work from home or get a nice office job.\r\n\r\nMy hobbies include writing for fun, like making fanfics. I\'m a sucker for horror movies and movies in general. Seriously I still collect DVDs like we\'ll have those for much longer. I also watch anime, not very much until recently. Just hadn’t found many dub that I liked and since I multitask watching dub is much easier to find the time for. Lately, I have had the free time to watch Demon Slayer and BNHA with subs thanks to quarantine. I\'m not much of a gamer but I do own a few and I watch a lot of streamers or YouTubers play games, they’re funny and make great background noise. I\'m not much of a reader like I was when I was a kid but lately I have been dipping my toe back in. I love books about the study of human psychology or culture, mysteries, fantasy, sci-fi, horror genre similar to Franz Kafka or H.P. Lovecraft. I love venturing out to restaurants and trying new types of cuisines or cooking new recipes from home, especially if I get to share them with others and hear what they think about it. I\'m a sucker for all things Japanese and especially their cuisine.

She's in treatment at this time, it's only 28 days. She was homeless prior, and basically cornered me into taking on the responsibility of my 15 y/o brother after my boyfriend had gotten shot (Dec 27th) through both of his legs and was unable to work. I'm working full time, plus I'm a full time online student. I have a lot on my plate prior to him even moving in.\r\nNow, him being here wasn't the issue. I could financially support it (up until last week bc I was laid off, but bf is back to work this week so YAY), but what the issue is, all school is canceled and he was required to work from home. I'm extremely laid back. My parents told me he's just being a normal kid when I bring this up to them. He doesn't clean up his trash. He ate 12 packs of fruit snacks and puked, left all the packaging on the floor and shoves trash underneath my couch. I have to tell him to shower and brush his teeth every day. He still wets the bed (I'm pretty sure it's a medical problem involving erectile dysfunction and we've been dealing with it for years), but I had asked him if he had an accident, to let me know so I could clean it up before it super soaked my carpet. He also had bathroom pads to prevent the carpet or couch from even needing to be cleaned...which he refused to use and he tried to make excuses for his laziness. The other night my friend, boyfriend, and I all decided we were going to take some LSD and have a good adult night in the safety of our homes. While we were peaking we had laughed for hours to the point of weeping. After everything was said and done, I made a comment that we had probably burned some calories. My friend, who is slightly overweight, became my brother's victim, with my brother basically fatshaming him telling him he could stand to lose some pounds. This isn't the first time he's made nasty comments like this. He's rude and cocky and honestly a condescending little know-it-all who's wrong 90% of the time.\r\nThen, the next day (yesterday) we were working on homework. He's reading Harry Potter and the Sorcs stone. I've had his English teacher back when I was attending the High-school so I know what's expected for class work. I was playing rocket league with bf and I was having him finish chapter 6 and read to 9. The kid pretended to read the same two pages for 30 minutes. Then he lied about reading, so he could move on to the work sheets. I saw through it, and told him to finish reading or else he's grounded from all entertainment devices and driving (he already was because he managed to take my mom's passenger side mirror off and run straight on into a pole to cut a corner and beat a stoplight in a matter of 3 days. No license either) he finished reading and did his work sheets. I went to check his work and his essay questions (this is a quiz) we're two sentences each with 5 periods scattered about. I told him to do it right, which resulted in a two day long argument about rewriting his essays. I ended up just kicking him out because it was like this any time we were trying to help him do something correctly, better, or more efficiently. His way was the right way, even if it was EXTREMELY wrong. I called my mom to discuss this with her and she started apologizing to him. I'm thinking about talking to her about putting him on the CHINS probation program if this is a consistent problem. There was a lot more of him just being a blatant butthole to my boyfriend and I, but that's pretty small compared to everything else.

For some guns, I'll be considering these, but for the most part, this is torso damage. I'll specify when it's a little more nuanced.

Kool-Kukumber,"['Daily Song Discussion - Movin’ On (S/T) \n We’re up to the penultimate track of S/T, Movin’ On, which picks up the pace a bit after a few slow numbers. The lyrics seem to be a reflection on the music industry, as the lyrics take aim at record company executives and the commodification of bands by the industry. The song’s titular hook is also likely a reference to Blur’s change in music style from Britpop to Lo-fi/alternative.\r\n\r\nMusically the song is driven along by some nice guitar playing by Graham, while Damon’s vocals are distorted in a similar manner to a few other songs on the album. Graham’s backing vocals during the chorus are also a nice touch that play well off Damon’s distorted vocals.\r\n\r\nLyrical highlight: At the music heist, I met the gourmet man, With aluminium lungs, Who sucks out all he can”\r\n\r\nMusical highlight: Guitar work, backing vocals\r\n\r\nBest performer: Damon, Graham\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>', 'I remember really not enjoying the album the first time I listened to it, but it has grown on me a lot.

The lyrics of the track acts as a criticism of consumerist culture, with Trimm Trabbs being the name of a popular type of sneakers manufactured by Adidas. The narrator of the song states that despite having the same footwear as “the flash boys”, he still feels empty and alone. The address said at the start of the song is apparently for a hotel in West Hollywood, and was presumably a hotel the band stayed at while on tour.\r\n\r\nMusically the song starts off somewhat strangely, with a quick piano riff followed by some Yoko Ono-esque vocal inflections by Damon, before settling in to a steady pace with Damon’s vocals backed by some guitar and a nice drum beat by Dave. Many have remarked that the song’s chord progression bears a close resemblance to the song Wined and Dined by Syd Barrett, who Blur have stated are one of their biggest influences. Around the 3 minute mark the song changes dramatically however, as it explodes from the blocks thanks to some heavy guitar playing from Graham, with the outro containing some chaotic playing from Graham and muffled screaming from Damon.\r\n\r\nLyrical highlight: “I've got trimm trabb, Like the flash boys have”\r\n\r\nMusical highlight: Guitar work, drumming, piano riff\r\n\r\nBest performers: Damon, Graham, Dave\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>""]",M

This reddit is an amazing resource for fish info and you should 100% take advantage of it to the fullest, whether it be general info, questions, anything!\r\n\r\n[General tank stuff:]\r\nBettas need at least a 2.5 gallon tank, and would recommend 5 gallons or more if possible. You’ll need a heater and thermometer for your tank, they do best around 78-80 degrees F (just be careful and do research about the heater you get! low quality ones have been known to cook fish). A filter too of course, whatever the right one for your size tank is. Depending on your filter, you may have to find a way to baffle it, as bettas don’t like too strong of a water flow. There are lots of ways to do it! People often use sponges or cut up a piece of water bottle, look around and you’ll find some different methods. \r\n\r\n[Decor:]\r\nLots of hiding places! The more filled your tank is, the happier your boy will be. Just make sure there are no sharp edges or holes he could get stuck in on your decor. Lots of people will use live plants, but fake silk ones are easy to start with! Make sure they’re silk and not hard plastic, because hard plastic can rip through his fins. \r\n\r\n[Upkeep/Water stuff:]\r\nThere are good guides for tank cycling on this reddit, make sure to check them out! Read over the article for fish-in cycling carefully, it’ll be really important for his health. You’ll want to get a good test kit for your water, preferably the liquid kind (it’s the most accurate). I use purified water for my tank because I’m in a dorm and there’s a refiller just outside my room, but tap water is fine as long as you add water conditioner to it to make it fish safe, which you’ll also need to get. I use API stresscoat, but a lot of people swear by Seachem Prime. I’d also get a gravel vacuum/siphon, a good tank scrubber, and a nice big bucket for water changes. It’s good to do partial water changes on your tank about once a week, it keeps your water and tank clean!\r\n\r\n[Feeding:]\r\nYou’ll probably want your staple food to be pellets. They’re an easy and nutritious way to feed them. I believe there’s a page on this reddit listing a few high quality brands, but personally I use Omega One brand. I give mine just a few pellets in the morning and a few at night. It’s also good to give them a little variety!

I NEVER thought I’d be able to before. I pay about $20 for a month’s worth of T. If you end up going the injection route, I do weekly subcutaneous injections, and with the needles I have, the actual needle part is only like an inch(? or so) long, so if you’re afraid of the needle ask if you can have a really short one.

And for a long time that build worked and it still works well, but I wanted something crazier. Something sillier. Something tankier. Legendary Heroes Banner comes around with Spring Xander on it. And when I saw that Carrot Lance I knew that THAT was the weapon I needed. Stops any chip damage and helps her feed everyone some Vitamins. As soon as I rolled him I didn\'t even check IVs I went straight to Effie and fed her the lance. Worked up some refining stones and got her that defense boost along with summoner support and I made this monster. Her only big weakness is green mages, which is what makes Zelgius such a good pair up for her. Distant Counter and not terrible RES allows him to clear the way for anybody else who might come her way.

misshawk763,"['I was raised in a secular household yet became religious of my own accord over many years. That being said, I’m not going to sit here and tell you that just praying when you doubt the faith your parents have chosen will improve your mental health. The o l’y way you can improve your mental health is to engage in therapeutic practices and possibly seek professional help from a registered psychologist. \n\nPrayer and spirituality can be beneficial if approached in a mindful way. This concept is actually something I learned within a 5 month period both in the secular (via Dialectial Behavioural Therapy) and religious (via extended Orthodox Christian catechism) contexts. \n\nAs with anything in life, you need to be in the right frame of mind to gain the benefits of whatever you are doing. If you want therapy to work, you need to be consistently willing to work through the exercises that the psychologist tells you to go through between sessions. If you want prayer to work, you need to be consistently willing to look beyond yourself and try to apply the parables of your religion to your everyday life AND prayers. If you want to be a scientist then you need to be willing to do the study and research consistently over many years. \n\nIt has been surprising for me to find that my Dialectial Behavioural Therapy parallels the lessons I have been learning through my religious readings and research over the past year. \n\nI sincerely hope that you find the courage, strength and method to overcomes the troubles you are facing❤️', 'Of course mate!

It is such a big issue for me that that my psychologist spent most sessions helping me overcome the habit of self imposed isolation when I feel like I have made any potential perceived mistakes during social interactions. \n\nSince COVID, I have basically had to self isolate and almost never allowed to attend church thanks to government regulations. I also had to leave my ESA (parrot) with my parents so I could move 200km to attend on campus classes for my youth work course; classes have been postponed indefinitely along with my placement. \n\nMoving had me put into a unit with a genuinely psychotic young person who completely burned me out and set off the worst parts of my BPD in a matter of 7 weeks. Cost me a fortune to move and now an entire semester of additional tuition fees because I haven’t been able to do any of my studies this semester because I am not coping with everything happening around me. \n\nNow I’m at the point of avoiding my medications, self starvation, not keeping my environment clean/tidy, not staying hydrated and ignoring all my usual routines/habits. \n\nIt makes me so furious at the world and particularly myself because I feel like I should have breezed through this semester without drama or failure. \n\nPlus deep down the fact that I have burned out/not coped with the past 3 months Has me completely doubting my suitability for youth work to the point where I sometimes think that I will never be able to have a normal life and sometimes find myself within i would just drop dead from a heart attack. \n\nTL;DR : I’m not coping with the current COVID world, doubting my career change choice, angry that I have spent so much money moving 200km to just lock myself away in Isolation while avoiding study anyway.', 'While I was creating my character for the “Trials of the Underworld” event (in Brisbane next month) he flew over and picked out the d10 from my dice box 😂\n\n[edit1 : fixed two typos]\n[edit 2: fixed sentence structure]']",F

Lately, they've all been shitting on me, because my character has different morals and ideas, and its pissing me off. Ex. Said I wasn't worth much as a party member even though I was crucial in a huge fight where at least 2 of them probably would have died. They've also been ignoring story elements in favor of shitting on me. Ex. Said we were attacked because of something I did, when the attackers said they had been told to attack us before I even did the thing.

I mean I am Non-Binary but as in my original gender.)\r\n\r\nI need to mention that I was most likely parentified and never had my brother or my mom there for me emotionally. My dad was the only one who actually was with me both physically and emotionally but still couldn't be with me all the time since he works most of the day to keep our family going.\r\n\r\nCharlie has a very overprotective and motherly  personality while Cameron has this tough and brother like personality.\r\n\r\nI have seen Cameron getting hostile towards those he doesn't like (Or that make me feel I'm a negative way) but calms down after Charlie argues with him.\r\n\r\nI guess I made them to help me with my depression since I have tried to self harmed before. They're more like voices in my head then visible characters but I know how they look. Kind of. When ever I think badly of myself or have suicidal thoughts or get mad I'll either be calmed down my Charlie or motivated by Cameron. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's normal for me to do this but here's the shortest I could make it.

Aces1312,"['Hoping someone can relate. Trying to work through some stuff. \n So in September I admitted to myself for the first time that I might be transgender (FTM) and I still mostly feel like that is correct. In October I came out to my closest friends, who have all been nothing but supportive, and right after my 22nd birthday I cut off all my hair for the first time in my life. I nearly cried I was so happy. I switched my pronouns in November with and got my first binder. I had been in therapy already and saw a dramatic decrease in my depression following these changes (like from suicidal to nearly nothing). Sure the depression still fluctuates heavily, especially now that I’m home again where I’m a “part time boy” as my friend and I call it since I’m not yet out to my family. \r\n\r\nI know I feel best when binding, with short hair, and in men’s clothes, and I know that I can’t help but smile when I hear “he” or “sir” used for me, but I also have days where I doubt everything and think that I’m just pretending because I’m unhappy with my body. I try to convince myself on these days that if that were true my friends wouldn’t be pointing out my increased confidence in how I look, my decreased instances of self harm, or the fact that I haven’t stopped thinking about coming out since I said it to myself nearly 9 months ago. I have a new therapist now who helps me with this, and was able to tell me I fit the description of gender dysphoria, but I still find myself thinking that I am lying to him, to myself, to my friends. I think a big part is anxiety. And more is the feeling that I can’t be trans because I didn’t know until now (I know plenty of people don’t), because I did have long hair and painted my nails (though I think that was a show off thing because it was nail art). Some days I feel ok with my body, but I recognize those days I’m usually binding and in clothes I like. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and don’t feel dysphoria and feel fake. Sometimes I still dream that I am a woman, or don’t feel as upset hearing “she/her” from family, but still get upset hearing it from strangers. \r\n\r\nI know these things don’t really matter, my heart knows that. My heart knows the misery I felt/feel in my body, the fact that I’ve never felt like I belonged with the girls, the overwhelming disgust I felt when having to shop for bras, the fear and discomfort of getting a period, the secret wish for breast cancer to chop off my chest, the hidden fantasy of being a boy that was suppressed for years. My heart knows all of these things, but my brain keeps telling me “you lived 22 years just fine, why change now? Why risk your family?” My brain tells me “what if you regret it? What if not seeing yourself in the mirror is better than what you’ll see if you transition?” It would be so much easier to just stay “female”. I made the decision to come out at the end of quarantine because I usually live on my own, and I’m sick of not being me, but I am so scared to lose my family, even though I say I’m ready to cut ties. I’ve spent my life living to make others happy that I don’t know how to live for me. \r\n\r\nI’m not really sure what I am hoping to get from this post.

Partly because I was busy with life so didn’t really have the time to dedicate to Tera or any MMO for that matter.\n\nThen there is the fact that virtually every other MMORPG out there is destroyed by their developers... or corporate greed. Seeing this really put me off of playing any MMORPG ever again. But more on that later.\n\nOut of curiosity (and because I have nothing better to do in a lockdown), I installed some of my old favourites to see what happened.\n\nI didn’t even look at Lineage II. It was dead to me 5 years ago, and I don’t expect anything to change. What did break my heart was how Aion has been pretty much murdered into oblivion. Not only are all my characters gone (all the items, gears, enchantments, everything), but they deleted all the areas in the main continent except for one. You used to have a good quest series that took you on a journey across all the places the game had to offer. Now it’s all gone. The one area they left is for power levelling without any effort whatsoever, where new players go all the way up to level cap. It’s heartbreaking. There were so many beautiful places and exciting side quests. Just... why? At this point, new characters might as well start at level cap. Or get rid of the levelling system altogether. Because that’s pretty much what they did anyway.\n\nWhen I installed Tera (EU), I had my expectations very low, and I didn’t even want to go on, just see how they ruined this game. And to my surprise, they didn’t.\n\nWhy do I say that?\n\nYes there is a main quest series with an arguably great story that takes you on an interesting and exciting journey across the <BOLD> entire map. Not just a carefully selected few towns in a quickfire levelling spree. Every place, every area, every town the game has to offer. Instead of cannibalising low level areas for the sake of veteran and high level players (or flat out deleting those areas like Aion did), it keeps all the places in the game intact. But it doesn’t stop there. The game makes use of the areas it has by offering random timed missions for high level player in areas that were meant for low level players. Even the main quest series eventually takes you back to the beginning, to places you were at when you were just lvl 20, to hunt lvl 65-70 bosses and monsters, or save that big-ass sky whale.\n\nTera didn’t get rid of “useless areas”. They took the effort to keep those areas and expand on the things they have to offer.\n\nThis is great for veterans and new players alike. Because there is a great chance a player at the endgame stage will be at a beginner area and meet with new players. So new players can ask for help, and we, who are at the endgame, can offer our help and make it fun to more people. Meeting new people, making new friends, or just being kind and helpful to those in need where we can easily help with the resources and knowledge we have about the game.\n\nTera doesn’t segregate new players from veterans like every other MMO does.\n\nTera doesn’t delete the entire map to make space for high level players. It uses the map it already has and takes even the most seasoned players back to the beginning, right where we started, and makes it fun.\n\nSo there. There it is. I love this game and it’s so good to be back!\n\nValkyon Federation veteran WillowRain, reporting for duty!']",F

Quite the contrary actually; I’m a sword wielder in any game I play that has them. And the bigger the sword, the cooler I tend to think they are. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, Swords in D2 appear to be in a rather awkward situation. They don’t provide the efficacy against bosses that other heavies do (not talking about exploiting ammo-less Swords) and are pretty trash in PvP against most competent players (definitely lacking in comparison to rockets). \r\n\r\nSo why don’t we change what role Swords are supposed to fill?\r\n\r\nI propose that Swords:\r\n\r\n- No longer require ammo. \r\n- Kill Guardians in 2 Swings. And nerf the tracking they have to be comparable to regular melee. (If you wanted to get creative, maybe sword hits to the back could 1  shot like melee hits in Halo did). \r\n- Benefit from melee related passives (such as striker or arcstrider trees) for PvE. But they only benefit from range/speed perks in PvP (to prevent them from becoming OHK monsters). \r\n- Go from 3rd person to 1st person (never made sense to me why they need to be 3rd person and encourage cancerous corner camping in PvP). \r\n- No longer occupy a heavy slot. \r\n\r\nThis would allow Swords to be a fun alternative to gunplay without micromanaging ammo in both PvP and PvE and without breaking the game balance. \r\n\r\nShotguns/snipers/rockets would all trump in PvP, but in PvE Swords could be useful for add clearing or even do potential big damage with a proper setup (but still put players at risk).', 'New to the Community and figured I’d post this here.

In the context of Bloodborne, perhaps Izzy was a Hunter or member of the Healing Church, that went against the norm of hunting  beasts and the worship of the Old Blood, by making forbidden weapons. Perhaps he was a White Church member? After all, the White Church garb states that those men and women believed in exposing themselves to the sickness firsthand, to learn more about it. Maybe Izzy wanted to learn more about how the beasts worked, what fuelled their ferocity and wild strength. Maybe Izzy wanted this power for himself, power that he was strictly told to not use, to NEVER even think about. \r\n\r\nLocations of items and hunter gear throughout are important to us as lore enthusiasts.

They are essentially narrative foils during the first four seasons before ultimately teaming up in the final season. You highlighted another thing Glimmer and I have in common: Having a very-good-to-great support system (in general), even though we don’t utilize it as much as we “should”, take it for granted, etc. Between Glimmer, Cassandra, and Catra, it is pretty safe to say that Glimmer has the best support system (generally speaking) out of the three.', 'Awesome!

It is a solid series that I would rate 8/10 (about the same as <ITALIC> TLOK). Have you seen/heard of <ITALIC> She-Ra and the Princesses of Power yet? <ITALIC> SPoP is another awesome series on Netflix that reminds me so much of <ITALIC> A:TLA for many reasons, including: complex characters who are also very relatable, story structure (well-developed plots), emotional weight, and the noticeable improvement with every new season (the last seasons of both shows are among the greatest of all time imo).']",M

Thank you for informing me on this though. I will be talking to my doctor and am going to try to find  a therapist that I can talk to about this. I think part of my issue is that it's just so hard to express myself in a way that's gender neutral or androgynous when I'm getting read as male all the time since testosterone is so powerful.

JustAGamer14,"['I need to get something off my chest that has been on my mind for some time \n Why is when a straight couple is in public and idk holds hands no one points it out and doesnt get screamed at while when a gay couple that\'s somehow ""shoving down people\'s throats""? Straight people always get representation in every sort of media, to movies, to music hell even in advertisements but when there is LGBTQ representation everyone\'s like ""this is stupid and unnecessary"" I just think it\'s a double standard. And of course the iconic ""don\'t expose my children to this stuff!!"" yes I\'m aware kids learn from experiences but just because they see a guy and another guy kiss doesn\'t automatically make them gay, and parents don\'t realise that if kids actually do get exposure to us they will soon realise we\'re people too and that we\'re no different that anyone else. When I was a kid my parents never told me we existed and so I always felt uncomfortable watching or listening to gay people and I was a homophobe. Till then I became a teenager and I learnt that gay people aren\'t horrible people and 1 year later I found out I was bi! I just wished that people would see this side but of course not. I understand we now rights but in some countries just being LGBTQ is against the law and even a death penalty. I just really hate the phrase ""stop shoving it down my throat"" it just makes me feel left out, I want to express my sexualilty like how straight people can but I can\'t. I just hope the world gets better for us, we\'re still people, we\'re no different than anyone else, we deserve human rights, we deserve to express our sexualilty without getting screamed at.
