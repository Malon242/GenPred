Putting empty glass vials of used medications in syringe containers is an appropriate way to get rid of some thing that A: will be sharp if it breaks and B: should not be put in a regular landfill where the medication can get into the ground water.\r\n\r\nAgain, glass vials of testosterone will be sharp if they break in a regular trashcan. This puts waste management workers at risk of injury. Do not throw your empty small breakable glass vials of testosterone in the garbage.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, testosterone can be absorbed through the skin if you come in contact with it. It is also an environmental pollutant that can affect wildlife. Do not put it in a landfill where it can get into the soil/groundwater. Putting it in your sharps container where it can be safely incinerated with other medical waste is appropriate.\r\n\r\nYou can also use alternate containers than sharps containers if you have no other option and are looking for a way to safely get rid of your used sharps. Look for a bottle made of thick plastic that cannot be punctured by needles. I would recommend laundry detergent bottles because they are large, easy to find, and very sturdy. I have also heard of others using thick plastic milk cartons. Make sure to duct tape the lid shut when you are done using it.

(13) \n Next song up in the discussions is B.L.U.R.E.M.I., which definitely ups the pace a bit after the measured 1992. The lyrics of the song seem to reflect upon the music industry, and how pop groups are just part of cycle that are dealt away by record companies once their popularity wanes. This is also shown in the title of the song being a combination of the band’s name and it’s record company, EMI. Damon’s criticism of sampling in the song’s lyrics is also somewhat ironic considering he himself would be undertaking sampling in Gorillaz just a few years after this album was released.\r\n\r\nMusically the song starts with somewhat creepy vocal sound effects by Damon, before throttling into full gear with a fast tempo and loud guitars. Graham leads the attack here with guitar playing that calls back to previous songs such as Globe Alone and Chinese Bombs. Alex also delivers some nice bass playing while Dave holds it all together with some uptempo drumming. The song’s length sets it apart from most of the album, as it clocks in at only a little over 2 minutes.

Then, in walks the Nos primogen, a native man played by a white man who went by Fred in character (not a very native name to my knowledge), who overheard me considering leaving without the context that I was considering leaving the cam.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to tell me I should leave and ""Go back to where I belong"", to which I informed him, first in character then out of character, that my brujah is from here, born on the outskirts of the city, but he just kept ranting about how terrible \'the brittish and scottish\' were and how we should all go back to our countries of origin. He then asked my character exactly when she was born, which she didn\'t have on hand because she\'s not the sort to memorize things like that. I then returned the question to which he said he was born in ""The year the winter stayed long and the spring was short"", which is literally every year in canada. When I pointed this out in character he threatened to declare war on my entire clan and the prince had to shout us down to get us to stop.\r\n\r\nI\'ve since left for personal reasons but to my knowledge Fred\'s player was never given so much as a warning for his behavior because he was a founding member and the ST we were playing under refused to punish anyone who\'d been around longer than her for anything.\r\n\r\nEdit: Cease, this post does not deserve updoots.', ""Oh, right, my bad.

We found some kind of weird box set of The Mask (which I had never actually seen and now I never want to).  The “box set” was a vhs tape of the movie and a book also titled The Mask.  We looked at the book and quickly threw it away after seeing that it was full of photos of naked holocaust era toddlers being tortured and experimented on.

He then put me down, hooked everyone, and took me to the hatch.\n\nIt was interesting to say the least.  Like, their goal is to kill you.  Sure.

stardustclub,"['Good point!! Do you have any suggestions as to what I could do to make the healing specific to the experience with the deadname? Also thank u :))', 'One year since my suicide attempt \n Whoa okay. This is gonna be long. Today’s really weird for me. I’m a couple hours away from being officially 365 days away from the weirdest, most unexpected day of my life. May 27th, 2019. I feel like weird is an understatement but honestly that’s what it was. I didn’t know that I was gonna try what I did that day. Essentially I tried suffocating myself but it didn’t work but I feel the need to go into more detail since I haven’t really thought about everything that happened in those couple hours and everything that lead up to that moment. I was probably dealing with some pretty bad depression and anxiety/possible ptsd from living in a unique family situation for a couple years prior to this point, but I don’t think I ever got as hopeless as I did for about year before I attempted. I was also self harming almost daily for that year as well. At some point during the actual ‘attempt day’ this sudden wave of almost determination and realization washed over me, it was so weird. I KNEW I was going to die that day (obviously I didn’t actually know but I really felt so sure of it). It felt like destiny except that word has a good connotation. I tried seeing myself Alive and doing literally ANYTHING even a few hours later and I just couldn’t. I tried calling a hotline but I got put on hold lol. It sucked back then but looking back on it it’s a little funny to me now, I guess I laugh at it cause it makes it easier to process. I just remember crying so hard because I was in so much pain and I remember whispering “I don’t want to die” over and over again while I was crying. I’m not much of a crier but the tears were just pouring out and I had to silently sob because my family was on the other side of the bedroom door. I didn’t write any notes because everytime I did that I’d end up changing my mind and I really didn’t want to change my mind anymore. I just wanted to go. I might have been self-harming when I realized that I didn’t want to wait for things to get better anymore, I wasn’t tired of the pain as much I was tired of just plain living, no matter how good or bad life could have been. I kind of realized how stupid self harming was, if I hated my life I should just end it right? My brain has kind of erased a portion of that day from my memory so I really have no idea how I calmed down from it but I remember lying on my floor staring at my ceiling fan and just pretending I was dead, trying to strangle myself with a bathrobe string, I was really close I think but my head would get really tingly and I’d start going a little unconscious and I just couldn’t physically finish myself off. Like I said, no idea how I calmed down but I eventually just ended up going out of my room in a haze and I’m pretty sure I ate carrots and then my dad started interrogating me because my eyes were red from crying and he thought I was high. My dad isn’t the best and it didn’t help to get yelled at minutes after I just tried dying. Things didn’t get better until probably three months later. Overall, it’s safe to say that I’m in a much better place than I was a year ago. I met my current girlfriend, I discovered my own spirituality, I feel like my life turned around. I absolutely still have my lows, actually I’m sort of having a low right now, but my “happiness baseline” as I like to think of it is so much higher. The last two weeks leading up to today have been rough, I’ve felt a lot of emotions. I regret doing it but I also regret not dying while at the same time I’m so happy to be alive. I feel a lot of guilt for being so willing to leave everyone in my life behind, because I know there’s people that give a fuck about me. I feel guilty for not being grateful enough for my life. I wasn’t able to get professional help because 1 - shitty health insurance and 2 - my father has an untreated mental illness himself and refuses to let me see a therapist. It sucks but that’s the way it is for me and trust me I’ve thought of everything. It’s okay though because luckily I was able to pull myself back up but I do wish that I didn’t have to do it alone. To be honest I’m a little hurt that the people who know Th at I attempted haven’t said anything but maybe they think it’s a touchy subject, plus that’s a bit selfish and attention seeking of me so I’m not holding any grudges. Despite everything, I am really happy to be alive right now, even though things could be better. I’m about 9.5 months clean from self harm so that’s good! There’s a lot of things I have to be proud of myself for so I’m gonna try and focus on that. I just wanted to make this   to actually face the events of that day and share it and see if anyone actually reads this. Don’t want anyone to worry about me though, I’m honestly really okay now.

Then later I brought up how that\'s kinda offensive and found out my mom just doesn\'t care what people identify as unless they use it to exploit others, although I\'m not sure I believe that as it felt like she was trying really hard not to say anything else offensive that she believed. Then I brought up a similar conversation with my dad and he said that he thinks people shouldn\'t hate people for things out of their control and they should be more accepting and agreed with me when I said the only people that shouldn\'t be accepted are ones that are unaccepting or hurt others.

Your beautiful radiant smile and how your teeth always look so white. Your long chestnut hair cascades over your shoulders in waves and all your little flyaways (you call them baby hairs) dance around your hairline. Every single time I see a flower, I want to pick it for you. \r\n\r\nEvery single time I hear something I know you'd find funny, I repeat it in my head over and over so my scatterbrain won't forget it and so that I can deliver the punch line. But, I always stutter. I can't help it. You make me nervous in the best possible ways. And you stutter too, dork. \r\n\r\nWhen we kiss, I feel so comfortable and loved. Your kisses are the closest thing to heaven on earth and your cuddles??? Come on! Drugs are supposed to be illegal. But, here I am. Addicted to you. You have this smell and I'm 90% sure that it's just your pheromones but you smell like home to me. When we hug and I wrap my arms around you, I never want to let go because there is such a comfort in your embrace. \r\n\r\nThe passionate fire you have when we do anything sexual. The lustful glances you shoot me when we're staring at each other. The sweet smiles you have when you think no one is looking. The thoughts that you conjure in that beautiful mind of yours. The caring, patient and supportive soul you harbor is unmatched. The way you hold me and comfort me when I cry and check on me every few minutes because you know how anxious I am. The way we can talk about anything and everything no matter where we are or who is around. The way my heart threatens to leap from my chest when you hold my hand or call me handsome. I love how reaffirming you are of my gender identity and how you always validate my feelings. I love how much you care about all the little things that upset me or increase my anxiety; so you help us avoid them at all costs. \r\n\r\nI love all the little adventures we've been on and how we never seem to finish a movie. All the art we've made together. All the songs we've danced and sang to. How my heart skips a beat when you text me and how I grin ear to ear when you call me. Your voice. I could listen for hours. \r\n\r\nThe pain and hurt I feel when we argue. The sadness and anger I feel when you're hurting because I don't know how to fix it. The absolute loneliness and emptiness when I don't fall asleep next to you. You complete me. Your laugh is unlike any other laugh I've ever heard and when I make you laugh so hard you cry, I feel like an Olympic medalist. I love when things remind me of you and I can't wait to tell you about them. Or when you have a story and you get so expressive while telling it. I love rubbing your soft skin and trailing my fingers along your arms. God, how you love cheeze its and coffee and I make sure to surprise you with them every once in a while.

When theorising about transgender experiences, questions of subjectivity and objectivity, of power, ideology, and authority, frequently get raised. If you want to put it within a philosophical framework I can quote philosopher Talia Mae Bettcher who writes: \r\n\r\n<ITALIC> \\~Gender identity is something we have first-personal authority about. In that sense, it’s like other mental states, like wishes, or desires, or pains, or pleasures; things that I am generally considered an ‘expert’ on rather than other people. Gender identity is existential, it’s about “who we really are”.\\~  \r\n   \r\n The other point of your argument is just conflating gender with biological sex. It wasn’t nonsensical for me to inquire how you apply genetics into your day to day delineation of determining a persons gender. You just want to defer to genetics because it seems like an authority while showing a disconnect that gender identity does not solely rely on genetics. How much stock are you putting in your genes in how they shape your gender? How you present yourself? Who youre attracted to? You can prove this how?

He’s a literal manbaby and a misogynist who expects you to do all the household chores and isn’t gonna do shit if y’all are even going to have babies. \nAll that pressure is gonna stress you out while you try to keep up for his validation. You’re probably gonna divorce him.

Why would I want to be trapped with somebody I’m settling for? That wouldn’t be respectful to him, it wouldn’t be respectful to me. The latter in the first place, my needs are important.\n\nWhy would I be together with someone who watches porn? With somebody who gets off to female exploitation on camera? I don’t need a beast with no morals. I’m not interested in that. I’m interested in a compassionate man who is affectionate and respects me, and respects women in general enough to not watch porn. I’d rather be single that with somebody who watches porn. If that disqualifies majority of men, that is fine. I’m not begging anyone to be with me. My standards are important to me.\n\nWhy would I want to be with someone who doesn’t find my pleasure important? Somebody who isn’t considerate of my feelings? Somebody who is misogynistic? Somebody who learns sex from porn? Somebody who is manipulative? Somebody who doesn’t respect my boundaries? Somebody who isn’t affectionate and sweet like I imagine my dream partner to be? Fuck yes I’d rather be alone. If most men truly are polygamous cumbrains who want to have sex with other women as well like the manospherian alfalfas say, and actually all want to have a threesome.... why would I bother myself with such a creature? \n\nI don’t believe they all are, obviously. I believe in love and good men. But if they were all like that, why bother? I don’t want a beast who is a slave to his biology. I’m not like that, I don’t want a partner who is like that. That is fair. If most men are porn addicts and walking stress givers like I see so many of my girl friends and women on the internet ranting about... why would I want to spend my energy on such a creature? I don’t need a creature like that take away years from my life because he’s stressing me out. \n\nWomen nowadays are expected to cater to their partners and all their needs.

Expected to be cool with their partner watching porn and deal with everything that comes with it, from porn based sex to limp dicks to dead bedrooms. The expectations for women nowadays are way higher than for men. Both in how they look as in how they act. \n\nBeing celibate forever doesn’t induce any negative emotions in me because fuck that noise. I don’t feel like catering to anyone and accepting less than I want. And I don’t really need sex. Plus I’m not interested in having children even if I meet my Nigel. I don’t mind being alone, so I just shrug at the idea of being celibate forever. It would be cool to meet a man who is worth it, and I’d be happy if I met him, but otherwise yawn, couldn’t care less. Single & childless women are the happiest demographic anyways cuz they have way less stress and responsibilities flung at them.\n\nMy expectations aren’t even that high, just treat me with respect, put in effort, and don’t watch porn.

We have both been open that we want biological kids together as well as adopt when we are ready. Unfortunately the window for having kids together is closing soon. She has her first appointment for HRT early June and would like to start as soon as she can. HRT will make it so her sperm is infertile. We have considered the option to freeze her sperm for 5 years. We dont have that money ufront so we have saught out help from family as her birthday gift. Unfortunately she does have some transphobic family members who will find about her transition through asking and we might not have as much support as we could from the family. Freezing sperm is also not a guarantee as we would have to use it within the 5 years and it would be less viable than naturally conceiving. \n\nWe have talked about having a kid now. We have both felt an inkling at the back of our heads for about a month to say ""f<HEADING> ck it"" to birth control methods and let\'s have a kid. We discussed it a little bit when it first popped up but left it for a few weeks. Yesterday we had an in depth discussion of where we stand on this issue. \n\nOur relationship is relatively new as we have only been together 4 months and known eachother for about 6 months. We talked a lot in the first two months of getting to know each other and within the first few months of dating we covered big topics such as marriage, future career plans, how we would raise children, etc. We have been living together, sharing a room in a three bdrm apartment for the last 2 months due to quarantine. We have also gone through a period of two weeks of self isolation due to Covid-19 together. We have successfully been able to communicate through it all and we have yet to fight and yell at each other. We have had disagreements but we have been able to work them out without much problem as we have strived for open communication throughout our relationship as well as understanding when it comes to each other\'s emotions. \n\nWe believe that regardless of whether we stay together or not, we would be able to co-parent a kid because of the strong communication skills we share. We have both stated that we aim for marriage in a year and that we see eachother as potential life partners but we are also aware that unforseen events may occur. \n\nWe are both young and in university, my partner is taking a year off to work after graduating from a one year program and I am going into my second year of what will likely be 5 years of school. We know that financially and emotionally it will be hard to maintain school, part time jobs and a child. I am willing to reduce my courseload or take a break to take care of the kid and home as needed but my partner has such a good career ahead of her that she will be continuing on her schooling so that way we can afford a familly.\n\nHer family would also be a great help and support if we had a kid because they are pro life and have a 2 month old right now. We would be able to have hand-me-downs of baby clothing and other stuff like toys. They are also very caring and would likely help out when we need it in terms of caring for the child for some time during exam season and also extra help. They live in the same city as us so it make it easier to ask for help too. \n\nFinancially it would be hard, my partner has a job and I would be finding a job before hand as well. Our student loans would give us a little extra money to get by as we have a dependant under our care as well as the gov helps us out too because we have a child. We would also have at least 9 months to save up to the best of our ability and collect clothing and such. \n\nWe are asking for any advice or opinions or other things we have not considered.

So a cheetah in captivity that always has enough food and water would prefer to Chase their food rather than just be fed in a dish. Similarly in the wild although it's a necessity and takes a toll on them physically, cheetahs do greatly enjoy the hunt and chasing their prey.

Freddie Quinn (They/Them) \n <BOLD> Age: 23, <BOLD> Birthday: September 16, <BOLD> Height: 170 CM / 5\'7"", <BOLD> Weight: 150 lbs. / 68.04 kg, <BOLD> Race: Scottish and Latinx mix, <BOLD> Alignment: Chaotic Neutral\r\n\r\n<BOLD> All You Need to Know About Their History: They were quite the loner in the human world. As a child, they stuck with older cousins a lot and it gave them a wiser perspective compared to their young classmates. It stuck as they grew and it slowly became easier to make friends as the people around them grew older. At 23, they have a few close friends but none as close as their cat, Lucifer, a sweet black cat of 6 years old. They had graduated from college and were ready to start job hunting to gain the funds to move out of their parents\' house. After a month of tedious searching, they were finally on the bus to a job interview only to be whisked away last minute to join the Royal Academy of Diavolo. They hated it at first, it had come at a time where they were getting their life together, but now after a year there they dearly miss their seven best friends and boyfriends.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Character Changes After a Year: They had come as a grouchy, apathetic human that really only cared about getting their life together and spending time with their cat. The separation adjustment was hard, but they grew to love the brothers. Each brother had taught them to be kinder to even the darkest of demons. They discovered how brave they were thanks to the events of CH 16, and their strength in overcoming the night terrors the events had given them. After a year they are softer, kinder, braver and more firm in who they are as a human. They were cynical before but now their jokes about death hit much closer to home. They were never comfortable as being seen as feminine until they saw strong demons walking around wearing nail polish and Asmo being fabulous as ever. The softened their cold rebellious exterior to allow their heart to cherish and enjoy the brothers\' company. Finding happiness in teasing and joking with each brother until they eventually had to return home. Freddie never really had close friends that they felt bonded to until the brothers, now they find themselves longing for an excuse to return to the Devildom.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Personality Traits: They\'re very apathetic about most things unless it involves them or it endangers their peaceful way of life. They are carefree and value everyone\'s own freedom but need to remember to put themself first more often. They\'re a foodie, enjoys exploring new foods from any realm or culture. A huge participant in Mamo\'s shenanigans and a proud member of the ""Lucifer You Suck"" club. They use to cook for themself often and enjoys helping the brothers in the kitchen, but loves having the occasional meal alone for their own pleasure. Huge introvert that needs to lock the door when it is their alone time since some of the boys don\'t understand how draining it can be being an introvert in a house with seven other people. If it serves one of their whims Freddie will lie to achieve their goal. They protect Luke from the brother\'s rude attitude and coddles him, they have also baked together before. They believe in change and actively look for ways to be better than who they were. Overal has a kind and caring soul but will knock someone into place if necessary, even if that someone is Diavolo.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Has never once used the pacts to force the brothers to do anything against their will unless it meant furthering their own agenda or for entertainment purposes.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Likes: Following their heart, food, naps, breaking rules if it is convenient for them, horror movies and games, loyalty and annoying Lucifer.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Dislikes: Obeying any authority or law, hates ignoring their whims or needs, hates the idea of stopping someone achieve their own form of change or goals, and loathes boredom.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Relationship With Each Brother: Wrote this somewhere before but I\'m doing it again. I\'ll use friend a lot but Freddie is canonically dating all the brothers, it\'s complicated with Luc though.\r\n\r\nFreddie had grown the closest with Belphie as they bonded over his dedication to help right his mistakes and similar pains (Fanfic headcannon on Reddit profile because I\'m not re-explaining it). The two nap together and avoid people by hiding in the Twins\' room or in Freddie\'s room since Freddie gets the most privacy in their own room. Together the two are the chill, laid back couple that enjoys spending a lot of time together even if they\'re five feet apart and not talking. Both can be clingy but Belphie is clingier since Freddie is an introvert who enjoys their own space as much as they enjoy Belphie\'s company. It\'s a headcannon that they are Belphie\'s shoulder to nap on even if they\'re standing in the middle of public together he will just lean on them to take a half-ass nap.\r\n\r\nBeel loves sticking close to Freddie because they have deep pockets in all their jackets full of snacks, originally for themself but now it\'s mainly for Beel\'s pleasure. Freddie loves cooking a big breakfast every morning and helping each brother with the meals even if it\'s not Freddie\'s turn. They\'ll go out often to restaurants together and if Beel wasn\'t there Freddie brings back extra food just for him. Freddie\'s tastebuds are quite adventurous making them the perfect partner for Beel\'s appetite. They feed each other from the other\'s plate because Beel knows he\'s going to eat more than Freddie anyway. Freddie makes a small plate with something from each entree Beel orders and enjoys watching Beel chow down on everything. It reminds them of when they use to share similar tastebud adventures with their mother before she passed.\r\n\r\nLevi is their best and gamer friend, they bond over all sorts of fandoms that they share with each other. Considering Freddie is a major introvert Levi was the easiest brother to initially get along with because their hangouts consisted of silence as the two partook in their own activity, sometimes in silence, and would often flaunt any victories or theories either had to share. It was originally Levi\'s room that they use to bum out in whenever they didn\'t feel like going to class or they wanted to stay up late playing whatever two-player he had just gotten. Now, they hideaway with Bells in his room or the three lock themselves away together.\r\n\r\nSatan is another fandom friend of theirs, the two love going on aquarium and museum dates. They share fascinating conversations of theories on demon and human topics or movies and TV shows the two have gotten into. Freddie has even gotten Satan into anime, he\'s still very particular about which ones he watches but Freddie is starting to understand which ones he actually likes, usually psychological based ones. He admires Freddie\'s intellect since Freddie is the second person in the house hat the others go to for help in their studies. Of course, Freddie also shares photos of their cat with him. The two tease Lucifer together especially since Freddie has a cat at home with the same name.\r\n\r\nMammon is one of Freddie\'s shopping buddies, occasionally either one will spoil the other. It\'s much rarer from Mamo but Freddie doesn\'t mind since they love giving gifts, they know to limit themself with Mamo because he can begin to expect something even if Freddie already said no. After starting to hang out in the beginning Mamo was their going out friend that showed them around the Devildom, though most of their adventure consisted of dumb pranks on each of his brothers. Freddie bravely ate the custard, got disgusted and threw it in Mamo\'s face and did not lie about it. They joke around and tease Mamo just to see him get flustered and deny his obvious feelings, but Freddie will do the same to whoever mentions it.\r\n\r\nAsmo is the gossip, hype friend that Freddie enjoys shopping with to flaunt new styles or outfits especially if they\'re not sure if it\'s a good look on them. Freddie never painted their nails once in the human world, but after their pact with Asmo he helped them paint red/black nails that had a gold stripe down each nail. Together they relish in teasing the brothers with flirtatious comments and making dirty jokes, Freddie can dish out the compliments and flirty advances but can rarely handle Asmo\'s. They usually get flustered and walk away. It\'s canon that they\'ve gone to a sex shop, and a flustered Freddie agreed to try some of the stuff they bought with Asmo.\r\n\r\nLucifer is the most complicated relationship they have in the Devildom. It\'s similar to the non-existent relationship they had with their authoritarian dictator of a father. Their father often bossed them around and told Freddie what they could not wear, do or say. It made them very resistant to authority figures once they began developing their true identity that they have now. The two bickered a lot at first, Freddie never being afraid to stand up to Luc, even calling him Daddy as a joke or Luc/Luci to piss him off. They began to enjoy being the brat in his life, even gladly partaking in the ""Lucifer, You Suck"" with Satan and Belphie as the three plan pranks to ruin his day. They are the brat in his life but also secretly his favorite pain in the ass. As time went on, the two actually share equal ground and open honesty. For the most part, Freddie is honest since they still very much enjoy ruining his day. Now they do it to teach him a lesson or remind him to let loose and have fun once in a while.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Their Relationship With Side Characters: These relationships are not as deep and perfect as the ones held with the brothers. Freddie rarely sees anyone outside of Lamentation unless they want to make plans every other week to get out more.\r\n\r\n Oddly enough they get along with Diavolo, for the most part. He does have the tendency to boss Freddie around and is often silenced by Lucifer to save Freddie from the wrath of the demon prince. Freddie prefers Diavolo when he\'s cooking up some weird plan and loves getting involved especially if it messes with the brothers.\r\n\r\nBarbatos is a great pal that has taught Freddie many new recipes in the kitchen including Devildom recipes and cheats for when they return to the human world and want to relive his treats.\r\n\r\nSimeon is on good terms with Freddie and the two get along, but Freddie only likes seeing his face. They have yet to gain any extravagant interest other than seeing Simeon as eye candy. It does not mean they will pursue him, they actually can appreciate beauty and not lust after every pretty face.\r\n\r\nLuke is a sweet child in Freddie\'s eyes that must be protected and wants to protect his innocence until he is ready for the grown-up talk. They bond over sharing baking recipes and has even gotten into baking because of Luke. (If you\'ve seen OBAngyne\'s grown-up Luke then you\'ll get this next part) If he every glows up like Simeon Freddie will have very confused and conflicting feelings. \r\n\r\nSolomon gives Freddie shady vibes, but they know its due to his all-knowing wisdom. They enjoy his mischievous side as he always appears to be calm and kind, appreciates when he lets loose with Asmo and hopes the two date one day and encourages Solomon to teach them about magic even if they can not perform spells. Actually find him more attractive than any of the brothers, but refuses to engage any romance with someone they still consider a stranger on important levels for a relationship.']",NB

brokenlampPMW2,"['(SPOILERS) Hell\'s Kitchen Power Rankings - Episode 5 (Nov 2) \n Interesting stuff from the kitchen last night - here are my power rankings after Episode 5:\n\n<ITALIC> What this is: If you didn’t catch these last episode, these are my power rankings after each episode. It’s essentially who I believe to be the strongest down to the weakest. These do not necessarily reflect who I think is going home next, and aren\'t scientific or insider-y. Without further ado, let\'s get going! (Spoilers for most recent episode, obviously)\n\n1 - Mia (Last Week’s Rank - 1)\n\nIt was a bit of a rough week, but it was concentrated around a single moment. Plus, another great challenge showing. I see no reason to move this rank, really.  \nEDIT: I posted this in a comment to defend my ranking here a bit: ""I\'m not biased towards anyone, but it does take into account previous weeks. I kept Mia out there because the edit, whether it was entirely accurate or not, only had one mistake within the service and it didn\'t impact the team\'s chances of winning in a significant way. Granted, that was a BIG mistake and if she doesn\'t figure it out before the end of the competition, she\'ll be gone. That said... She was, in my mind, the clear number one until tonight\'s service and had a good challenge, so that one mistake was not enough to have her lose spots in my mind. If it was as impactful as Kevin\'s in episode four, she\'s have lost more spots. For now? She\'s one in my ranks. That could fall.""  \n\n\n2 - T (Last Week’s Rank - 2)\n\nThe challenge win and a night on service that didn’t have any major flaws. The one thing to point out would be the mistakes with Ariel, but that wasn’t really T’s fault.\n\n3 - Gizzy (Last Week’s Rank - 3)\n\nDoesn’t it seem like Gizzy’s getting a winner’s cut? I mean, that’s what I thought BEFORE the interactions with sous-chef Christina, but then the show did that and slammed the audience on the head with the idea. Performance-wise, I can’t really add much to what Gordon said.\n\n4 - Heather (Last Week’s Rank - 5)\n\nIt still seems like Heather’s going to stick around until around the early black jackets time-period. Strong enough to stick around for now, but she doesn’t seem like a season-winner to me.\n\n5 - Kanae (Last Week’s Rank - 7)\n\nKanae wins a lot of challenge matchups, and gets a lot of confessionals, and gets next to no screen-time in the service. That’s a great combination to take you to black jackets. After that, we’ll see.\n\n6 - Roe (Last Week’s Rank - 6)\n\nNot a great challenge for the second straight week, but what I said last week stands. Still probably safe for now, albeit in an unspectacular way.\n\n7 - Jose (Last Week’s Rank - 9)\n\nChef Ramsay really tends to like the more cooks-out-of-heart chefs that go through this competition. It was another strong challenge for Jose too.\n\n8 - Motto (Last Week’s Rank - 8)\n\nMotto still could benefit from a standout performance, but he’s not yet near the back of the pack in my mind. Until the pack behind him gets leaving a little faster (which is probably happening soon), he’s probably okay.\n\n9 - Ariel (Last Week’s Rank - 10)\n\nNot the greatest showing early on in service, but a nice challenge performance. It seems to be getting closer to the point where I can know what I’m seeing here.\n\n10 - Trev (Last Week’s Rank - 11)\n\nHe’s been helped a lot by the sudden fall of Kevin, but he can’t hide as much anymore. It was a solid showing in the service tonight, though. There are three chefs that, in my mind, are farther back than him.\n\n11 - Bret (Last Week’s Rank - 12)\n\nHe doesn’t seem to have the performance-level to back up his fire most of the time. I feel like he’s only an episode or two from leaving the competition.\n\n12 - Scotley (Last Week’s Rank - 13)\n\nThis guy’s gonna be under a ton of pressure in the next couple of episodes, because Ramsay decided to eliminate the better veteran in favour of the young-dude-with-potential. Scotley needs to step it up, though, because right now, he mostly reminds me of contestants that went home first or second.\n\n13 - Chris (Last Week’s Rank - 14)\n\nIt’s amazing that he wasn’t nominated. He made Kevin look terrible early on, didn’t know what to do for tableside, didn’t know timing for scallops, still screwed up the scallops after being TOLD the time from a former runner-up, and has been consistently terrible all season. If he was still on his previous team making these mistakes, he’d have been nominated for sure.\n\nE - Kevin (Last Week’s Rank - 3)\n\nI think Chef Ramsay saw that Kevin had less to fight for for in this season, so he decided to keep a younger guy and let the veteran go back to his successful post HK career. I get it, but I think Kevin’s a stronger chef than Scotley. That said, with two nominations in a row, it was getting a little clearer that he wasn’t going to make it to the end. (Also, thanks for essentially spoiling the ending, promo-team!) For those curious, IF he had stayed, he’d probably have been around the 5-6 area in rank.

Recently changed pronouns? Join my Zoom discussion group! \n I find that sometimes it\'s easier to try them out with strangers, see how it feels, or start talking with supportive folks for your name and/or pronouns to help it feel good, automatic, and like you. It\'s a neural pathway that needs to be formed, I\'ve heard various estimates on how long this takes (66 days, 492 times, etc.), so let\'s start greasing that groove together!\r\n\r\nI\'m hosting a few Zoom groups meant for social connection of non-binary/GNC/trans folks, with the primary goal of allowing participants to try out or get more accustomed to a new name and/or pronouns.\r\n\r\nAbout the meetings:  \r\n\\- Times/dates vary. My time zone is the Western US, but I\'ll try to find times that work for everyone interested, if they vary widely. I\'m limiting these to 6 people per group due to the dynamics of group conversation. If there is wider interest, I\'ll make them ongoing.  \r\n\\- I\'m doing this for free, so I\'m using free Zoom which is limited to 40min per session. I will open a new room at the 40 min mark and we will all switchover. In total each meeting will be 80 min (1 hour 20 min).  \r\n\\- You will need to have access to Zoom.  \r\n\\- I prefer that everyone be on camera, but it\'s not required, as long as your audio is working or you can type in the chat.   \r\n\\- I know that some of us may have a few different name options we are deciding between. You can discuss this or your options in the group, but I ask that you please choose only 1 to be identified by for the duration of the meeting. Put it in your Zoom ID name along with your pronouns (I can guide on how to do this if you do not know).  \r\n\\- We will do a round of introductions with name and pronouns.  \r\n\\- I don\'t want this to be extremely structured or artificial, but in order to avoid Zoom Silence... I\'ll have a few prepared questions & conversation topics. Some serious, some fun, some random. I\'ll post them on screen share. We will go around & each person will choose a question, or create one of their own, & ask it to another person, using their name. Then anyone can comment on their answer, or contribute, being sure to use names and pronouns as much as possible. (E.g. ""Ash, what\'s your favorite food?"", ""oh my gosh, Riley, I\'m having a similar experience."", ""I really resonate with what they were saying about representation & how meaningful that is."")  \r\n\\- Please come to the group with an intention to be mindful and supportive of everyone. Use their correct name and pronouns, they will be displayed on screen. Sometimes, even trans and non-binary people can misgender others, so if this happens, catch yourself, apologize, correct yourself, and move on.\r\n\r\nMeeting with internet people will always carry some amount of risk. But some steps I\'m taking to help with security:  \r\n\\- I am not posting this link publicly. I will only communicate date, time, zoom link, and room password in private messages.  \r\n\\- After someone messages me expressing interest, I\'ll vet by reviewing your Reddit history & ask you a few personal questions.  \r\n\\- Please be mindful of your personal safety. I know that so many of us are not in living situations that are supportive of this process. You can go do this on your phone in your car, outside, or while on a walk. You can use headphones on your computer inside & no one will hear people referring to you. If you need to duck out unexpectedly or turn off your video, that is ok.\r\n\r\nAbout me:I am non-binary.

Didn’t know where else to put it.) \n My mother is overprotective and has been that way since I was little. My father on the other hand is not. The two being separated led me to live both sides of the story. It’s gotten to the point recently that I hate my family a little and have a hard time communicating with them so I wanted to share. Hope maybe people can relate to this or see this and see why sometimes being overprotective can be harmful (you may have varying opinions, and may disagree with this but this is my opinion and take.) \n\n1. Overprotective parents make you feel like you always have to be secretive about what you do and what’s happening in your life. In my experience it feels like you have to hide everything you do because your constantly afraid that your parents are going to find out and if they also tend to be very strict you feel as tho there gonna punish you for even the smallest slip up. It feels like your constantly looking over your shoulder and stressing over wether or not your gonna do something wrong and then get punished for it.\n\n2. You feel trapped with little freedom. My parents have always been very strict about the people I hang out with and the contact I have with the outside world, especially when it came to things like the internet and Social Media. I was not allowed to have any kind of social media until I was in high school and my internet access was highly limited, and while I understand why it made me feel alienated from my peers at times and prevented me from gaining much knowledge of what life was really like. For the longest time I felt left out cause so many of my friends had social media and could contact each other on it and all I could do is watch. My friends and even sometimes my dad would push me to get it but it wasn’t until later when I was about 14-15 that I got it because I was afraid my parents would punish me for having it. As for the internet I learned was to get around the bans on it and had to learn to sneak time watching videos on YouTube because my mom was so afraid that I would come into contact with something that could influence me in negative ways. And while again, I understand now why she did that, it wasn’t very helpful because I still found ways around the internet ban and honestly have helped form some of my bad habits now. I also think sometimes that not being able to communicate with other people stoped me from learning many of the trends and social Manners that come txting and evening talking to people and made it harder to learn how to fit in socially when I was finally allowed more contact with friends and over the phone. I still feel lacking in that area today\n\n3. The little freedoms that you gained over time could be taken as punishment which made you even more cautious about what you let your parents know about what you like and about your life. Getting things like a phone and being allowed to go do things with friends felt like very big steps towards freedom. But the fact that they could be taken at a moments notice for doing something wrong led me to be even more secretive and taught me to hide things that I thought would get me in trouble from my parents. Those freedoms being take away are valid enough punishments at times but sometimes it also feels a little like your being trapped in a cage and force to stay there. While those punishments are not necessarily terrible, (or at least I can see why there done at times)  when it feels like those freedoms could be snatched away at the drop of a hat so soon after getting them make you feel the need to hide your actions and reasons in case your parents don’t agree and you somehow get in trouble \n\nI’ll end this here for now. I have much more that I was planning to write but this is already long and likely boring. Plus I’m tired. Hope this gives a least a little insight as to why overprotective parents can be stressful or cause issues. Not saying it’s always bad, but it is not something that I personally feel works well as a good method of parenting (altho what do I know right I’m only 17 and have no desire to be a parent, at least for a very long time. But having had overprotective parents I feel as tho I can give a little information.)']",F

lukeasaur,"['Recipe:\r\n\r\nTurmeric rice: Add about a tablespoon of turmeric, a third of a can of light coconut milk (full fat’s probably fine, but since it’s being used as cooking liquid for rice I figured thinner is better), and four rice cups (the little cup of rice that comes with a rice cooker) of white rice to your rice cooker; add water to the fill line, and set the rice cooker to white rice. \r\n\r\nTomato “tuna”: This is the star of the show. For full effect, start by peeling the tomatoes: start a pot of boiling water and prepare a bath of cold water. Once it’s really rolling, cut an X on the bottom of 2-3 plum tomatoes and dunk them in for about 45 seconds to a minute (you don’t want to cook them). Fish them out and dunk them in the cold water. Peel them from the X. After they’re peeled, cut them into quarters and scoop out the seeds. Then dice them.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not up to the whole mess of boiling, I get it! In that case, just dice them. It’s not as close to a marinated tuna bowl from a sushi bowl restaurant, but it still tastes good, and it makes this recipe 10000x easier. \r\n\r\nEither way, once your tomatoes are diced, put them in a bowl or wide mug (if your roommates used all the bowls and didn’t wash them), then add around a tablespoon each of sesame oil and olive oil, and a good pinch of salt. The salt isn’t just for flavor - it helps the tomatoes express extra juice - so don’t skip it and expect the same results! Refrigerate for at least half an hour, but it’ll last longer than that if you want to prep it in the morning and eat it when you get home. Drain off the excess oil and juice (in my experience, more than half the oil drains off, so the 2 tablespoons isn’t as much as it looks like, but you need enough that it gets into all the tomatoes). \r\n\r\nSpicy mayo: You can buy this in the store, or make it yourself by mixing about 5 parts mayo, 1 part sriracha. A few drops of sesame oil can add a nice flavor. Vegan mayo will work fine! Avocado mayo will work fine! Low fat mayo will work fine! Don’t stress it!\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve assembled these three ingredients, you’ll want to take a bowl and add some warm rice, between 2/3 and 1 1/4 cups depending on how much you like rice (you don’t want it hot - if you’re microwaving pre-prepared or leftover rice, try ~30 seconds). Add the tomato, then add 1/2 of a small avocado, sliced thinly. After that’s done, top with the spicy mayo and some soy sauce. \r\n\r\nIt’s not a perfect recreation of the marinated tuna sushi bowls I used to eat - but it’s closer than I thought I’d get! Oh, also, if you’re interested in sushi-like food, try out the book Sushi Modoki. The idea of using tomato for tuna was adapted from the fatty tuna recipe in there, though I’ve changed the other ingredients.', 'Where I’m at it’s kind of a suburban middle aged upper middle class thing.

I know this is normal, but I just realized how much I was missing last night and it feels like I’m missing a complete part of my person. Does anyone have any advice as to how to process this realization? I know there is no one specific thing that helps everyone, but anything is useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was younger, my parents would argue a lot. My dad would never listen to my mom, he always seemed to treat her like she didn’t know anything. Anytime my mom would try to call him out on how he treated her, he would make himself cry and play the victim. It all came to a head, when my dad was afraid that my mom was going to leave and take me with her. He called his dad (who did not like my mom because she was “too dark” and had different (more progressive) beliefs) and they called the cops on my mom. I was four, I had been at my cousin’s house. I would be picked up and brought to my grandparent’s where my parents were waiting for me. Not even a mile away from my grandparent’s house, the cops pulled us over. I remember them asking my parents to step out of the car and after a long time I remember only my dad getting back in. Everything after that starts to blur. I know I was brought back to my grandparent’s house and I remember crying and screaming and I didn’t want anyone near me, I just wanted my mom. I found out from my mom yesterday that this occurred right after Christmas. After she was taken (she was not arrested), they just brought her to the station and her brother picked her up. I had no idea of this at the time. There is a whole section of my life after that moment I can’t remember. My mom was gone for 3 months after that. The only memory I have of those 3 months is when I got to visit my mom again in secret after my dad realized I wasn’t doing well. I turned 5 during those 3 months, I have no memory of this. I don’t remember school, or my grandparents, or my dad, or any of my dance classes (which I loved). After those 3 months, my dad let her come back, but she was locked in the house and my grandparents could not know she was there until 3 months later. I also have very little memory of this period. After this all took place, my dad told me not to talk about it. I still had no idea why any of it happened. It wouldn’t be until several years later I would ask my mom and find out many of the details I had missed out on or just could not remember. Apparently DHS had gotten involved, and the case worker (who talked to me at school at one point and I do vaguely remember that) who was in charge of the case closed it after looking into the situation and realizing that my mom had not done anything wrong. I know my dad was frustrated and said some things to the case worker because I’ve been told that the worker told him he needed to “grow up” and that my grandfather should “mind his own business.” There is so much more to this. My dad has constantly made me feel like I was wrong for feeling how I do about all of this and even has tried to make it out as though he had “no other choice.” \r\nI could go on, but my main thing is this. I thought I remembered a lot from my childhood, and I do. I can tell you all about every birthday I’ve had starting with my 3rd, except my 5th. I can tell you about the only time I had to write lines for a teacher when I spoke too much in class in 2nd grade. I can tell you about sitting in the loft in my 1st grade classroom with two girls that were new that year and what their names were (Elvia & Sky).

She picked me up and then we sat in the parking lot of Kroger and just talked for about and hour and a half, then we sat in front of my house for another hour and a half or so. We talked about so much. We talked about our families and our interests and shitty people. We talked about kinks and what we liked and sex.

Concretely, the only thing connecting all atheists is a lack of belief in a god. Whether they believe in scientific explanations or not is inconsistent and not pertinent to atheism. But let me explain your points from the most basic view of a lack of belief atheist. \r\n\r\n1. The universe had to come from somewhere.\r\n2. Evolution is <BOLD> extremely improbable.\r\n3. I can't find a good proof against the existence of absolute truths.\r\n4. There are things in the universe that cannot be explained by naturalism/science.\r\n\r\n1. Maybe that’s true. But so far any explanation regarding a deity making it doesn’t satisfy me in the way that would convince me. Maybe one did. But I’m never given a reason or explanation as to how that makes sense, and also never presented with proof of a god existing to do so beforehand. Furthermore, where would a god exist before the universe, in order to create it? I’m content with waiting for evidence and proof from people who study and investigate these ideas before claiming I know a god did so. \r\n\r\n2. How is it improbable? Furthermore, how is it being improbable matter when it has clearly happened? We’ve had centuries to study evolutionary methods and development, and we are as certain that evolution is actively happening as we are about anything in science. Just because something is improbable doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Maybe you mean abiogenesis, the process with which life is formed first before evolution. And while we don’t know how that happened exactly, we know it <ITALIC> did. Whether a god did so remains to be seen or proven, so I won’t believe anything regarding that topic concretely until something is found out. \r\n\r\n3. That isn’t how proof works. Proof is for positive claims. Proof is for things that can be proven to be real. If you try and prove a negative there will be holes and excuses until you give up. For example, I’m a hyper intelligent octopus. You don’t believe me? Prove me wrong. If you find my account saying otherwise I could claim I was lying. If you find my house I could claim I forwarded the IP address. If you find my “body” I could claim I’m an octopus on the outside of the simulated world. Proving a negative is useless, so instead proof lies with the positive claim. It’s up to <ITALIC> me to prove I’m an octopus, and up to <ITALIC> you to prove that absolute truths and a god can exist. \r\n\r\n4. What’s your point? Saying there’s something science can’t explain doesn’t automatically push that onto a god. People thought viruses were once demons, but we learned. They thought lightning was Zeus, but we learned. And we’ll keep learning. Attributing what we don’t know to a god stagnates our learning by presuming an explanation. I would rather not know and find out than assume to know on a guess or vague belief. Maybe we won’t explain everything, but we shouldn’t expect a god to be the answer for all we don’t know until we know a god can exist and do those things."", 'A word to my gay and bi guys out there: FOREPLAY IS STILL A THING!

completely_unaware,"[""I'm having a lot of trouble discerning who I actually want to be. Am I trans or just deppressed? \n NSFW part is labeled. I (AMAB 17y/o) have been struggling with a lot of self doubt and depression pretty much from the beginning of this year. Being 17, this was partially consequence of the overlap of a lot of different stresses - I was leadership on marching band, I was earning my Eagle Scout, and I was going through the exhausting process of filling out college apps. All of this stress was not helped by my parents' tendency to worry and have way to many 'serious' talk than I was ready to handle. I ended up pretty much shutting down. I cried a lot, I put on a happy face at school, and I slipped into the cycle of unhappily wasting my time when I had something to get done, and then having to stress over the fact that I never actually got anything done.\n\nDecember I came out to my direct family as bisexual (no real issues occurred). Starting November, however, I found egg\\_irl on my main and, deciding to separate this mess from my usual interests, I created this account.  I wanted to believe I was trans. I know that this is usually a sign, but I feel like I was also searching too hard for an explanation. Namely, an explanation for my inability to feel perfectly comfortable socially.\n\nAt this point, I looked back. However, it was hard to. My elementary school years held a lot of bullying but I feel like I repressed most of my memories from my time there. However, what I do remember is near the end of fifth grade, my dad gave me this advice: as an introvert, (I am) you often have to act like an extrovert to get what you want. While this is not necessarily bad advice, reflecting back, I am worried I took it too far. I'm worried that these past seven years have actually been spent repressing my identity, the sensitivity that had made me the subject of so much bullying in elementary school. So, I don't really know who's to say whether or not this dysphoria (if it dysphoria) has lasted long or not. I've always had 'boy' interests (MTG, video games, Scouting). One thing I do know, however, is I have always felt a disconnect between myself and who I see in the mirror.\n\nI have tried to get more social this year, but interactions feel off. Nobody else seems to register it but I constantly feel insecure about my interactions with other people, and I feel like I am often somehow excluded, even if there is nothing really keeping me separate from the group. I've been told that this is a common experience of people who turn out to be trans, but again, <ITALIC> I don't know.\n\nWhen I started to realize that my turn for the worse may actually have been the appearance of dysphoria, I kind of panicked. I talked to a close friend about it, but being a cis and straight guy, he didn't have much insight to offer (besides the fact that I probably needed a break from the internet). I got even more insecure about how I presented to other people. I talked my parents into allowing me to actually grow my hair longer in the back, since I usually get it cut down to stubble. This week, I used a facial razor and my parents' shaving cream to shave my legs. It did feel euphoric to see the bare skin.\n\nVoice: When I was younger I always hate the sound of my voice when it was recorded (I am unsure why, but I know that this is just a common thing independent of cis/trans). However, recently, I listened to some tapes of myself as a freshman and legitimately cried because I knew that I would never have that voice again. My voice now isn't particularly deep (I still get gendered as female by strangers over our scratchy phone line), but it <ITALIC> is masculine, and I still hate to listen to recordings of myself.\n\nNSFW part: <SPOILER> I mostly doubt myself because, while I feel that I do want breasts, female junk, etc. I don't really hate what I have. One exception though: looking down is more or less fine, but seeing myself naked in the mirror feels gross and wrong. My dick literally feels out of place. I have only ever been able to mastrubate if I don't look at it. On a separate note (I don't know if this is dysphoric or not) from a much younger age I have always had trouble keeping my hands out of my pants. My dick isn't particularly large by any stretch of the imagination, but it is always itching, and I always get the urge to adjust it, usually to no effect.End NSFW part.\n\nI really don't know where to go from here. Sometimes I feel like 90% sure I'm trans, sometimes I feel like it's closer to 50/50. I feel really uncomfortable talking to anyone else about this because I feel like telling someone you <ITALIC> might be trans has a more damaging effect on a relationship than actually coming out as trans. (Super liberal community btw. People might be shocked if they found out, but there are very few people that would actually hate me for being trans.) Anyway, thoughts? I really don't know how to deal with my feelings and figured that before I even consider getting an experienced therapist, it would be best to ask random strangers on the internet. (Yes that was partially a joke.) Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: I would like to thank everyone for the thoughtful replies and being willing to share their own experiences!

Woloa,"['The Sandy Tomb \n I\'ve been a bit hesitant to share this one as I usually like to be the hero in these stories but no one was entirely in the right here. This was a campaign run by Steve the Cleric from one of my <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. The setup was pretty good, a call for heroes came out from a major port city on the edge of a desert country (don\'t question it) as an ancient tomb at the city\'s center suddenly became unlocked. The place is filled with undead, seems to reset every night and no one who\'s gone in has come out. Our job was to get in and make it stop being unlocked before the undead decide to leave. For the record, we were using a slightly looser 3.5 ruleset.\r\n\r\nSorry if this whole thing is a bit disjointed, I am a man with bad memory working off memories of a game from 5-7 years ago that wasn\'t much fun.\r\n\r\nEnter the player characters:  \r\nMy first ever joke character and second TTRPG character ever, Gnomish Tuba Bard Katzmcgee Waffletoff, later replaced by raciest High Elf Sorcerer Ezekial Ravadera\r\n\r\nMy stepdad\'s worst character ever, the elf... something, Carzan\r\n\r\nA halfling druid and human cleric who\'s names I have forgotten because they aren\'t important\r\n\r\nand The Guide, human ranger/sorcerer and the only genuinely fun character to come out of this story.\r\n\r\nSo, the party get together and head into the tomb, all of the doors are double wide and open by swivling at the middle, creating two smaller doorways. A couple of rooms in, Katz finds a basket of undead bees, they attack him, of course, and Carzan just shuts and spikes the door, leaving him to die. Somehow, he didn\'t die but I was still mad about it. When Katz asked Carzan why he did that Carzan replied ""I\'m an elf you know"". This quickly became Carzan\'s catchphrase. It was bad.\r\n\r\nOur first expidition into the tomb ended with the party finding a pair of urchins who had somehow survived inside overnight and trying to convince them to go with us, Katz was an incompetent bard and could not inspire courage, my realization of this is what led to him being replaced after the first session with my own elf, who was the worst. Also, Carzan kidnapped one of the kids and forced him to basicly be his boyservant.\r\n\r\nEnter Ezekial Ravadera (henceforth known as Zeke) who\'s first act as a player character was to watch his own mother be stabbed and then disperce the guards she\'d brought along to find the culprit, loot her corpse and then leave, never to care again. He was the edgiest character I\'ve ever played by far. Zeke was specialized in social manipulation magic because I thought it would be interesting, low and behold, every enemy was either undead or elemental for the entire campaign and every one of the very few NPCs he interacted with had an exceptional bonus to will saves and the ability to detect spells being cast on them at any range. Additionally, after an incident where he drank a tiny water elemental like a fucking idiot, Zeke became the exclusive target of every single elemental we came across the rest of the campaign, they were DEDICATED to killing him and only him. We never found out why.\r\n\r\nThe human cleric was soon replaced by a dwarf cleric for reasons I have forgotten, his introduction to the party happened around the same time as Zeke\'s, which is to say: moments before a guard made a passive agressive remark towards Carzan, prompting the elf to kill the guard, which attracted more guards, so Carzan sat down and called for guards. Zeke and the dwarf slinked away together even though they were both raciest against eachother, prefering to be with eachother rather than near Carzan.\r\n\r\nOnce Carzan, The Guide and our druid were done dispatching like 10 guards they retrieved the rest of us and we elected to return to the tomb as a group. For reasons I forget Zeke had a yellow rose tatoo on the back of his hand that glowed on contact with things he already knew were magical and I thought this was a cool trait. In my defense, I was like 14 at the time. After this ground breaking revelation, the new dwarf suggested using his pickaxe to make some temporary shortcuts for us, only to find that EVERY wall and door of the entire tomb had an inner layer of some kind of indestructable, non-magical, heat proof metal that was entirely structurally stable in spite of being paper thin. \r\n\r\nThat was really the last event that occured before the campaign just kinda stopped, because everyone had a bad taste in their mouths and the only character liked by anyone other than their player was The Guide.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: Everyone was bad, I was among the worst and the campaign fizzled out.', ""Strange repositioning issue \n So, replaying the whole series recently, I found that I can't reposition units before a battle starts in the second game, but this problem only applies to Rook's crew, I can reposition members of the ravens just fine.

I feel like he thinks I’m a freak now \n Diagnosed only recently but I’ve been suspecting for years, and my teachers as a kid suspected.\r\n\r\nI lied about something to protect his feelings, long story short it wasn’t the right thing to do (despite me REALLY protecting his feelings), and he’s very angry for it. Our communication styles are sooo different. Almost incompatible, but I’m not sure.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure what he thinks of me after this argument. We kind of veered in a different direction. I tried to explain to him some of these things:\r\n\r\nI’m no good at eye contact, but I’m HORRENDOUS when I’m upset. Even my family says it. If I am upset, overloaded, etc, I cannot make eye contact. Apparently neurotypicals think that means we’re dishonest and lying more.\r\n\r\nI get over things relatively quickly because I am logical about them. This is a thinker vs feeler thing. My mom and dad have the same dynamic. My dad is pure thinker (and probably autistic), my mom is a feeler. And when they argue, my dad expects everything to be laid out on the table, and then forgiveness/discussion. I don’t understand why NTs hold grudges for the most part. I have forgiven my boyfriend half a million times for many things, why can’t he let this go? This is the first conflict in our relationship that’s wholly “my fault”, rather than a miscommunication or his fault. Logically everything’s been laid out. Forgive or don’t.\r\n\r\nI hate being touchy. I’ve never been a PDA person. Any touch I give you is well thought out and very meaningful. I don’t want to be touched when I’m upset. This angered my boyfriend.\r\n\r\nHe brought up that I’m so much better at typing/texting my feelings, why the fuck can’t I say the same thing out loud? To me it’s entirely different, and when I get upset IRL I become almost nonverbal.\r\n\r\nHe proclaimed that I care about my other friends more than him, and that’s obvious with how much I talk to them. Well, I explained to him that I could take or leave most people. I’m not particularly emotionally attached to anyone besides him, my mom and my best friend. Everyone else is.. this may sound sociopathic but not really important and I’m not very attached. This was shocking to him because I act like I care about people in a neurotypical way. It’s 100% masking. I small talk BETTER THAN HIM so I can mask.\r\n\r\nHe said our texting and phone conversations are dry. I feel like he wears his entire heart in his sleeve; and my inner thinking/heart is like an iceberg—only a small tip of it lies above water where you can see it. I can’t even begin to express myself beyond that.\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, neurotypical vs autistic relationship.

I’ve been suuuuuper confused about my gender identity, but have been feeling more and more like non binary describes my internal landscape. I’ve buzzed my hair, been occasionally wearing my binder (can’t do it too much because of a back issue), thinking about a reduction/top surgery, fantasizing about a more gender neutral name (been thinking about Sal). \r\n\r\nMy (amazing) counselor recommended a local LGBTQ non profit. I’m planning to try out a Zoom support group for trans* folks tomorrow. It seems like that might be a safe place to try out my desired pronouns (they/them) and perhaps use my name I’m thinking about. But I don’t want to mislead anyone or like...I dunno. Since I’m still confused I don’t know if it’s okay to do.\r\n\r\nI’m only out to my counselor, partner, and one friend. My friend has offered to be a safe place to try out pronouns and names which is awesome. But I’m wondering if it would be okay to do the same in this support group. My birth name is quite feminine and I’m curious how it would feel to try out something else. I like Sal because my birth name is related to Sally which is my grandma’s name and I like that connection.\r\n\r\nAny advice is appreciated!', 'I mean people discuss meds all the time here. Not sure what you think is restricting you. You can’t ask for specific medical advice, but you can ask something like, “Hey I tried Ritalin and didn’t like the side effects. Is there something else I could discuss with my doctor?”\r\n\r\nOne thing to keep in mind is that everyone responds differently. So there is no one medication that would work for everyone. If you want to ask about medication specifics, you have to speak with your doctor.', 'I still have ups and downs but my counselor has been the best support for me. She is not an addiction specialist but CBT has been helpful for me in changing lots of my unhealthy habits, because I’m able to understand why I do them.\r\n\r\nSome kind soul here also recommended Recovery Dharma to me. I haven’t tried a meeting yet, but am reading their book (free on their site). It’s similar to AA in that it’s peer led, but their program is wayyyy different. It’s based on Buddhist principles and for me it is much more helpful. I already have some Buddhism incorporated into my spiritual practice but you don’t have to be Buddhist to do their meetings. It’s about empowering yourself and using mindfulness and Buddhist principles to understand and overcome your addiction.\r\n\r\nThe whole “I’m powerless against alcohol” in AA was not helpful for me. I know it works great for some people and I’m happy it helps them. But for me it felt disheartening rather than empowering. As someone else mentioned SMART Recovery is another option!', 'This one!

I'd prefer blonde, but the teal could be super cute too!"", ""I don't know if this belongs here but these are my thoughts on my current state of questioning. I'm looking for clarity. \n So much of my identity has always been a reaction to how others see me, how they themselves react to me. I guess that's kinda what gender is, really, a set of conventions that others expect from you in presentation. Maybe that's why in 25 years I never realized I might be trans. This past year it's clouded my thoughts and unleashed storms that I've solemnly waited out until just recently I let it all wash over me and it felt so wonderful, so clarifying. What a grand affirming gesture it was to come out to myself! Then I came out to people I care about. I have the luxury at my age of having people I care about but don't owe anything. I've never felt close to genetic family because of this sense of obligation. My chosen family responded pretty well, though it's obviously been pretty difficult for my girlfriend, which has made it more difficult for me. I'm 6 months into the best relationship of my life and happier than I've ever been. And I've always considered myself a very happy person; I put the happiness of myself and others above everything else, in this short-sighted sort of way that has led me to never plan for my future and waste all my supposed talent and potential in college. What a luxury it is to be happy. I wonder why I think that. I think that's something we're all made to internalize, and that makes the process of transitioning even harder as we feel like what we're doing is superfluous. But I've rejected this thinking. Being happy is the most basic human right. I deserve it. Everyone deserves it. Fuck I don't know what I'm doing. Why am I even writing this? My stream of thought bounces around at such a pace with such dime-drop pivot speed, I wonder how I ever get anything done. Sometimes it really seems like I've never gotten anything done. So how the fuck am I supposed to turn myself from a soft but subtly manly boy into a beautiful woman? I usually don't have dysphoria. It almost feels like wanting to be a woman has led me to appreciate the manly elements I'd always thought I'd lacked. But I fucking hate them when I try to present femme. I'm vapid like that. I'm shallow. I wanna wake up looking like a porn star. I regret that so much of my gender questioning origins are tied into porn. What I crave is validation, the sense of truth that comes with a concensus reaction of belonging. What deeper validation is there than lust? What greater height of desire? I know, I know, there's so much more to being a woman. I want to discover that. But it's dizzying and unknown, so of course I return to something familiar. Perhaps each trans person's experience is inherently tied to and based around whatever we find most strongly appealing about our true gender. That's part of what makes NBs so cool. They're pioneers of a new gender horizon. I think I'm a bold and unique person in many ways and often wonder if I am my own sort of non-binary. But sometimes being a whole-ass goddamn woman just has such strong appeal to me. It's just so difficult to understand what I want without being able to visualize it, and it's tough to be able to visualize it without being able to present it, but it's tough to be able to present it when I don't know exactly what it is that I want. Thoughts like these circle around and form the vortex which sucks me into uncertainty again. And I'm back at the start, alone in my thoughts, with no progress made. I wish that I could just think it out, just focus and deliberate alone until I understand what I am and what I want. But so much of my identity has always been a reaction to how others see me.""]",F

I know “spaz” is considered a pretty serious ableist insult in Britain, but I don’t know anyone in the American community who particularly cares about it. \r\n\r\n(Either way, the concept of “reclaiming” it is silly in this context - the OP doesn’t have a degenerative condition, so they couldn’t reclaim degenerate if it was an ableist slur.

(This is because people who sexually prepubescent and pubescent kids are less likely to have a gender preference in doing so; what science exists on the subject suggests that it’s because secondary sex characteristics, which are what drives the experience of gendered attraction in most people, haven’t developed yet.)\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty small part of your point, but frankly it really irks me how cis women center themselves so aggressively in these conversations; it makes it increasingly difficult for people who are not cis to find space, even though they make up a sizable portion of the community. Around half of all binary trans people (very little difference depending on gender) experience childhood sexual assault; statistics on cisgender people vary hugely depending on how the question is asked, but between 2%-18% of cis boys<ITALIC>  and 10-20% of cis girls are victims. Trans women are way way* more likely to be victims of childhood sexual assault than cis women. \r\n\r\n*If you ask boys if they’re victims of pedophilia specifically, you get a very low rate. If you ask boys if their first sexual experience was when they were below the age of consent and involved an older individual, you get a very high rate. Meta-analysis puts the most likely rate at around 8% for cis men and shy of 20% for cis women, making cis men a bit less than a third of the CSA survivor community yet completely unheard of in most CSA spaces online.\r\n\r\nIt also feels like you’re assuming all femme women are cis and that your experience as someone perceived as a masculine women would be similar to those experienced by trans women, but I often go to conferences and did before I started passing, as does my (transfemme, feminine) friend, and the way she’s treated is completely barbarous compared to anything I ever got.

It’s essentially who I believe to be the strongest down to the weakest. These do not necessarily reflect who I think is going home next, and aren\'t scientific or insider-y. Without further ado, let\'s get going! (Spoilers for tonight, obviously)\n\n1. <ITALIC> Mia (Last Episode Rank: 2)  \nI don’t care what Scotley thinks. She’s stepped up as a leader, had an excellent challenge, and overall completed another episode at around the same level as the past.  \n \n2. <ITALIC> T (Last Episode Rank: 3)  \nStill not a ton of screen time, but that’s starting to be a good thing. As the cliche goes, “no news is good news,” and that’s usually good early on in this competition.  \n \n3. <ITALIC> Kevin (Last Episode Rank: 1)  \n""As long as he got through tonight, he’d be fine."" That was my mindset during elimination and it’s my mindset now. My views on Kevin have changed very little despite a rough night.  \n \n4. <ITALIC> Gizzy (Last Episode Rank: 5)  \nYou rarely see anyone on the elimination stand for tableside, and I didn’t think that Gizzy \twould get kicked out for something not really related to the main kitchen. She’s probably still fine for a while.  \n \n5. <ITALIC> Heather (Last Episode Rank: 6)  \nHeather was on her game tonight, much more so than the previous week. Continue like this and black jackets should be fairly achievable.  \n \n6. <ITALIC> Roe (Last Episode Rank: 4)  \nIt was a bad challenge showing for Roe, but nothing in the dinner service stood out in either a good nor a bad way. Roe is, in my mind, still likely safe for the next few eliminations.  \n \n7. <ITALIC> Kanae (Last Episode Rank: 8)  \nStill nothing significant to see in the service part of the show, but a strong challenge showing and a continued strong presence in confessionals brings Kanae up a spot.  \n \n8. <ITALIC> Motto (Last Episode Rank: 7)  \nMotto moves down simply because others have been stronger. It’s not really his fault, but he could do with a couple of standout performances.  \n \n9. <ITALIC> Jose (Last Episode Rank: 10)  \nWe’ve still yet to see anything from Jose, really. Nice challenge performance though.  \n \n10. <ITALIC> Ariel (Last Episode Rank: 11)  \nA good performance from Ariel, both in the challenge and in service. She’s still in that area where we haven’t seen quite enough of her from his season to judge exactly where she belongs in this list. Most likely candidate to dramatically shift spots in here, either up... or down.  \n \n11. <ITALIC> Trev (Last Episode Rank: 12)  \nNot a great night, and truthfully, I thought he’d head home. That said, it might have been just the one rough evening, and he could bounce back. I don’t see him making it anywhere near the black jackets though.  \n \n12. <ITALIC> Bret (Last Episode Rank: 9)  \nI personally don’t hate the passion, and <ITALIC> as long as his new team agrees with me, he should be fine for a bit. That said, the edit tonight made it seem a lot like this is going to be a recurring thing, and it’s not usually something that lasts too long. I’d be hesitant to keep my bet on him sticking around too much longer. Either that, or he does an underdog thing and makes it to black jackets. If I had to guess? The former situation.  \n \n13. <ITALIC> Scotley (Last Episode Rank: 14)  \nExcuses for not co-operating with a vocal leader won’t get you too far in this competition, \tespecially if that vocal leader is a top-runner and you’re in the lower tier.  \n \n14. <ITALIC> Chris (Last Episode Rank: 13)  \nChris, who was terrible in the challenge and terrible in the service, picked Mia as the weakest chef on that team when asked. Even if he was a top-tier chef on the team, which he isn’t, that shows a lack of credibility when faced \twith picking talent. That’s something Chef Ramsay is known to look for.\n\n\nAnother non-elimination night, but with the team realignment, something big could happen down the line. Hope you enjoyed tonight\'s episode!

I use 23 gauge 1 inch long needles to draw the estrogen out of my 2ml vials and I use 27 gauge 1.25 inch long needles to inject into my upper outer butt muscle (gluteus maximus). You can also inject into your thigh or do subcutaneous injections into your belly fat, but I have no experience with that. I buy the 27 gauge needles online since I can only find 25 gauge x 1.5 inch needles locally. I don\'t like those. I use 1cc luer-lok syringes so the needles don\'t slip off the syringe when injecting. If you\'re on Facebook, look for a group called MTF Trans HRT Hormone Forum and request to get in. I\'ve learned everything I know from them.\n\nYou can search on Google or YouTube for ""estradiol valerate injections"" and you\'ll get more information. Also look for Dr. William Powers. He has his own subreddit here and has a tremendous presentation on trans HRT. He\'s gotten a lot of his info for his study from elder trans women from that Facebook group I\'ve mentioned earlier.\n\nI inject small doses twice a week so my levels stay stable.

The lyrics of the song do carry the trademark melancholy of the MLIR album, but are quite oblique and up for interpretation. Some have theorised that the song is a reflection on the breakdown of Damon’s relationship with Justine Frischmann, with the line “You'd love my bed, You took the other instead” perhaps being the most direct reference to this.\r\n\r\nMusically the song does bear some similarities to Blur’s MLIR-era material, but is overall much different from the songs of that time. The use of piano and drums at the time gives the song a sense of forward momentum, while Graham’s guitar playing becomes louder and more experimental as the song goes on. After the 2 minute mark the song becomes purely instrumental, and this very long outro provides a snapshot of how much of 13 will sound.

I’ve only ever fallen for close friends before and when it’s been reciprocated I’ve mainly known for a while that I felt emotionally connected and attracted to them. In my  last relationship it took me a very long time to feel comfortable kissing my partner and for a while I wasn’t sure if I actually felt sexually attracted to them and it was scaring me! Eventually I was very much sexually attracted to them and was not only comfortable but excited to be sexually intimate with them.  \r\n\r\nSo basically I know I can be sexually attracted to people but I have to have a strong foundation of trust and be emotionally attracted to them before Im sexually intimate with someone. It’s very confusing because I know I love being sexually intimate with someone I love and I miss that very much so I’ve at times forced myself onto dating apps but nothing has ever really come from them because 1. I’m trans and that makes finding a partner hard enough on platforms that are mainly for cisgender folks and 2. The dating world goes way to quickly for me. I’ve had friends who talk about how they expect people to kiss them on the first date and I would never feel comfortable doing that.. I have no idea how to go about finding a partner who would be attracted to me or who I would be attracted to because I really really have to get to know someone as a friend before I develop romantic feelings or sexual feelings for them.\r\n\r\nWould love to hear anyone’s thoughts on this, feeling very discouraged right now!', ""Frozen 2 is sooooo much better than the first film!

We can't let the actions or decisions of the past keep us from pursuing happiness for ourselves now! I believe in you!"", 'As a MtF, lemme give you the tea. You might already know some or all of this, but just in case.  \n\n\nThe short version: Men face just as much women, and typically face the same issues as women do with some noteable exceptions. The only major difference however is just how swept under the rug these issues are.  \n\n\n<BOLD-ITALIC> Disclaimer: This does not invalidate, nor lessen the issues women face. All I\'m doing is pointing out that that men and women are two sides of the same coin, and thus face many of the same problems and just don\'t realize it.  \n\n\nContrary to popular belief, the media embelishes mens bodies just as much as it embelishes womens bodies. Every Men\'s Fashion magazine, Men\'s Exercise Magazine, every late night infomercial about <BOLD> MAX GAIN\'S <BOLD-ITALIC> EXTREME <BOLD> WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM AND SUPER-NUTRITIONAL WEY-PROTEIN POWDER COMBO INSURES THAT YOU\'LL LOSE THAT SPARE TIRE YOUR WIFE MAKES FUN OF AND GET THOSE <BOLD-ITALIC> EXTREME <BOLD> GAINS YOU\'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT that\'s really just snake oil effects men just as much as every photoshopped womens fashion magazine, models that are destroying their bodies just to keep their jobs, every <ITALIC> In this weeks issue of You\'re not a Good Enough Woman, here\'s 20 tips to shrink that waist-line that\'s based completely on the current trending psuedo-science that may have lasting, potentially dangerous effects along with romance tips from an Actress who\'s been married 6 times in the last two years! effects women.  \n\n\nBut in a truly awe-inspiring act of contradictory logic, many people, men and women alike, use same Toxic Masculinity logic of ""It doesn\'t effect men the same way it effects women. Women already have such terrible self-confidence issues."" which not only harms men, but infantilizes women. Men are human too, and constantly being told and being given examples of how you aren\'t good enough is going to make men have confidence issues just as much as it will women.  \n\n\nIt\'s the same with compliments. Women compliment each other <ITALIC> so much, but for men, compliments are few and far between. You go onto any post asking men about compliments and 95% of them will tell you that they cherish ALL compliments because they\'re so, so rare. It\'s like we\'ve been conditioned that woman constantly need to be validated, while men are supposed to assume that people recognize they did a good job, or look good, or did the right thing.  \n\n\nAnd then there\'s the <BOLD-ITALIC> REALLY touchy subject. Bodily Autonomy. Men exist in this weird super-position of have too much, and not enough bodily autonomy. On one end, women are almost universally allowed to hit, smack, or otherwise touch men with little to no recourse. A woman grabs your crouch on the bus or subway? Wow! You\'re one lucky fella! A man squeezes a womans butt on the bus or subway? If the woman speaks up, chances are he\'ll either be beat up (rightfully,) or arrested (rightfully,) or both (again, rightfully so.)   \n\n\nOn the other end, it\'s almost like men are made to make up for womens lack of bodily autonomy, which can be down-right terrifying. If a man and a women both get drunk, and in said inebriated state, decide to have sex with each other, neither can legally give consent, however, in such a case, the man is at an objective disadvantage. If the women decides that because she was drunk, and could not consent to sex, constituting rape, there is very little chance of the man being able to successfully fend off such accusations, despite that fact that he was also equally inebriated. What this means is that a man is, basically by law, required to keep his head while being under the influence of alcohol while a woman is not when it comes to drunk sex.  \n\n\nAnd again, I\'d like to point out <BOLD-ITALIC> THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT WOMEN DON\'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH TERRIBLE INEQUALITIES IN SOCIETY!!! All this post is doing is pointing out some of the inequalities that men face. This issue is that most people pose this argument too simply. This is not a two-platform scale where if one party is suffering, the other party is prospering. We live in a multifaceted society where both parties have benefits and deficits, mean of the same nature. However, one parties deficits are almost systematically ignored in leu of their benefits, and the other parties benefits are systematically ignored in leu of their deficits. And the most infuriating part of that is that the more extreme people from both parties work day and night to cover up the others deficits and benefits! Some men work tirelessly to make sure that women are seen as the lesser sex, and don\'t deserve the same treatments as men. And Some women work without break to make sure that men\'s issues are never even addressed, let alone fixed.   \n\n\nTL;DR Both sexes have a lot of the same issues, but people don\'t seem to notice that.  \n\n\nP.S. Sorry for the long post. I just personally feel really strongly about fairness, and any time I see anything that isn\'t fair, for men or women, I just get really heated. It\'s something my mother drilled into me as a child.', ""I think the reason it's not there yet is because of two reasons. \n\nThe first is that things like this necessarily take time. You have to think about how long drug tests go on for, and then probably double, or maybe even triple it since this is quite literally about changing someone's very DNA. Scientists and Ethics committees are going to want to make extra super duper sure that this method is safe.\n\nThe second reason is sadly there just isn't really a huge market on Trans effecting science. Even in the article itself, the effect this could have on the trans community is a secondary thought, an add on. I haven't exactly looked into the history of SRS, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was simply an after thought of doctors while figuring out how to reconstruct genitals of CIS people, but I could be wrong.\n\nLuckily! That will hopefully change! As time goes on, Transness is accepted more and more, and as that happens, more and more trans people will be able to make trans effecting discoveries that will help others!\n\nWho knows, maybe even one of our lovely trans redditors will be the very person to push this science through to human use!

Playing by ear always came easey for me, and I can usually play any standard rock/pop/blues and simple jazz stuff directly from ear without having to practice or test the chords/key first. Pretty much if I can visualize what the song sounds like in my head, I can play it directly. My hands know what to do when I imagine the sound of the note or chord. Better guitarists than me compliment me on this skill all the time. It makes me good at improvisation, but bad in general since I don´t ""have"" to practice so much unless the piece is very technical... \n\nToday I tried to learn some piano by ear the same way i learned guitar, but I find that I have a harder time finding the ""right"" way to play the chords, and that I constantly play the wrong inversions and such. If lots of keys are pressed at the same time I am not even able to hear how many keys are pressed or which hand plays what. I hear the key, I hear the chord, but I still cant do it right. Single melodies come easey, as I just imagine that the keys are a fretboard, but chords, especially using both hands = confusion. \n\nIf two different chords are played on top of each other with each hand, I just get super confused.  Why doesent this come naturally to me like with the guitar? The principles are the same, and I think it should actually be easier on a keyboard since it is basically a very long guitar fretboard that has the advantage that it can be pressed multiple places at once. \n\nI guess some differences are that the intervals on a guitar will always be the same no matter where/what key you play in, while on keyboard you have different color keys so it feels different from just moving everything up or down some frets,  you are limited to 6 strings at the time, and the posibilities are limited by the physique of the human hand. That maybe makes guitar less complicated, but still...\n\nWhy is this so hard for me? (Probably because I am not as smart/talented as I thought, but I honestly thought that being able to play guitar by ear would make piano come easey too).

He frequently lost his erection completely during sex. \nHe acted a bit outraged whenever I tried to seduce him somehow.\nHe had a very stereotypically ""gay"" voice, gestures etc, like from a stereotypical comedy movie. Sometimes he said unexpected things regarding homosexuality, out of the blue, like we\'re sitting in a park on a bench and he starts saying that he had a dream about two gays trying to make love to him (that\'s exactly what he said, he didn\'t use the word rape) and he killed them.\nOk, this one will be silly, but he saw penises everywhere.

I’ll add onto these with Willow Reichelt’s responses. Since the questions are the same, I’ll just number them.\r\n\r\n1) I strongly believe in gender equality, and girls’ athletics programs should be given the same respect, attention, and funding as those for boys. However, I personally have an issue with the sports academies in our district because they come with hefty fees. I believe in free public education, not a system that provides adequate education for everyone and then gives more opportunities to families who can afford to pay them.\r\n\r\n2) Yes, mental health is a key part of education. We need smaller class sizes so that students may make meaningful connections with their teachers. We need to introduce mindfulness programs to help deal with stress. We also need to increase the number of counsellors in the district (especially at the elementary level) so that struggling students can get the help they need.\r\n\r\n3) I would start by focusing on smaller class sizes and increased EA support. Older students also need diverse opportunities so that every student, even those who don’t plan on attending university, leaves high school prepared to get a job.\r\n\r\n4) Increased learning support. Every student can learn, and we have an obligation to make sure they have the support necessary to be successful. Every student who needs one-on-one attention should have a full time EA. We also need EAs to help with students with extreme behaviour so that teachers can focus on the rest of the class. No one should enter middle school unable to read, and we need to increase funding for reading interventions like the Early Success program.\r\n\r\n5) This sounds like a great idea, and I would support it if funding is available.\r\n\r\n6) Our district needs far more advisory committees to bring trustees together with everyone who will be affected by their decisions (students, parents, and staff members). There should be a student representative on every committee.\r\n\r\n7) There is no place for drugs and alcohol at school, and certainly anyone dealing drugs needs to face consequences. I personally believe in an end to drug prohibition for adults, but even if that were to happen, it would not extend to children and teens. I would like to see drug prevention programs in school that talk about the real costs of drug and alcohol use, but especially now that cannabis is going to be legalized, we need to acknowledge that many adults use alcohol and cannabis recreationally in moderation.\r\n\r\n8) Sexual orientation and gender identity are innate. No one can change who they are in this regard any more than they can the colour of their skin. Therefore, there is no appropriate stance to take on this issue other than full acceptance.\r\n———————————————————————\r\nThat’s all for now, but I’ll update and finish this later with all 23 answered, hopefully with some other candidates as well.

idkwhattoputhere000,"['Did you go cold turkey with makeup and shaving, what was your journey with it like? \n Personally, since discovering radical feminism, I’ve become more critical as to why I want to wear makeup, why do I feel better with it, why do I feel like I have to shave?\n\nI realised that it does come from a place of seeking validation from society and both the male as the female gender, and that putting my value on how attractive I look and adhering to modern day expectations of femininity is not something I do for myself. I do it for societal validation. For myself I wear 0 makeup and don’t shave my legs. Why would I bother, if it is for myself? For myself I choose comfort. The beauty industry is inherently anti feminist as it tells us our natural faces and body hair aren’t as “good” as altered.\n\nSo I started asking myself why do I feel better when I change the way I naturally look, it’s not like any of those things are unhealthy. It cannot be a natural drive to use lots of makeup or shave everything off. My natural face is natural. My body hair is natural. Which means it 100% is socialisation to feel the need to change it. The expectations of femininity lookwise have changed so many times throughout society, altering our body hair and wearing makeup don’t have a “nature” reason. Nature already gave us the “tools” , the way it is supposed to be. As long as you’re healthy, you’re fine.\n\nPersonally I stopped shaving my pubic hair as even before discovering radical feminism I found it way more... it sounds corny but empowering? I feel better with a bush. I shave next to my labia because that feels better to me but I let most of it grow. I’m wearing less makeup than I used to, like 10% of the time as opposed to 60% or so. I only wear a full face of makeup when I see the guy that I like (while he literally gives 0 fucks about it) , or when I go out. I feel good with it being like that, because I’m doing it consciously now and asking myself questions as to why I do it. I like wearing makeup, and I like not wearing makeup. I’m just as comfortable with both now. I used to be ashamed of leg hair, now I don’t have any problems with wearing a dress or skirt while having my legs non shaven and going to a park or so.\n\nI do still shave my legs for other occasions, maybe it is social conditioning, but still feel less like I HAVE to do it. I’m not as “ashamed” of visible leg hair anymore. Now I do it when I want it, and because I prefer it that way. But I’m not ashamed to sometimes go outside with visible unshaved legs anymore. I shave my armpits because I find that more comfortable personally when I wear something long sleeve but I’m just happy to be critical of it and ask myself “why?” . I think I have found a healthier middle ground. I’m glad I’m questioning my choices. It feels right, even if I choose to still wear makeup & shave.\n \n\nWhat was your journey with makeup and shaving like?

I was excited for everything I was learning, and happy with how things were going for me.\n\nThis past August I fell in a stupid (non-sport related), incident and broke my elbow. It was one of those freak accidents, wherein I had to fall perfectly in order to do it, but I fractured the radial head in spectacular fashion. To make it worse, the fracture was such that the doctor didn't want me doing any kind of physical activity, he was afraid that the smallest impact, the wrong type of jostle, could sheer off an entire chunk of the bone. I mean, if you're going to do something, do it well, right? \n\nIt's been a really difficult recovery for me, physically and mentally. It was such a slow process, and being away from my sport hurt a lot. \n\nMy trainer has been there every step, though. Including when my doctor thought I might need surgery, and added another 2 months to my recovery time estimate. D called me and told me to meet him at the gym, and sat me down to give me one of the most encouraging talks I've ever gotten. He told me to focus on getting better, and that he'd be there when I was. We'd get me back up to where I'd been. He told me to stay positive, and hopeful. It was obviously more intricate, but this is the gist. \n\nAnyway. The day is looming. I was cleared at the start of January to get back into the regular gym, and slowly build my strength back up. I was also told that mid-February, I could get myself back to boxing. Not full force right away, and not to the amount of days I'd been going. But I can begin to get that rhythm back, get my body used to the moves, hit lightly.\n\nI'm doing it Monday. I'm so happy, and a little bit nervous. Mostly nervous about how it'll feel. 5 months of doctor scare-tactics really stick in the head. I thought it might help to lay this all out here, in a space with like-minded people. Nervous excitement is one of those states that you don't think about much, outside of small dogs, until you're experiencing it. I kinda did feel like a small dog right now, running in circles to get everything ready, checking and re-checking my gym bag, even though it's only Wednesday. Simultaneously worrying if I'm ready, and wondering why it isn't Monday yet...\n\nIt did help a bit to write this out.\nThanks for reading."", ""I had a sim named Isla. She didn't like life much. While her twin,  Kenzie, thrived and was successful, Isla gained weight, played videogames all day to the point of soiling herself often because she just wouldn't leave the computer, and she rarely showered.\n\nWell, one day I decide to force her to get a job, and choose programming. She loves this job. She becomes a social butterfly, going out with work people to parties and clubs. Through this she meets Dorian.  Suddenly, she's working out, doing well at her job, showering regularly.\n\nDorian and Isla have a deep connection, and it's clear he's motivating her to be a better Isla.\n\nHe moves in, they get married.

It regards child abuse. \n This is gonna be a long post. But please bear with me. I need help. So I recently had a friend come to me for advise, and well I am a little distraught and upset. I myself and frustrated and at a loss because my friend is kind of a idiot, and is pretty oblivious.  He  seems to think that family could never abuse a child. The reason he came to me is because I personally was abused and that includes sexual abuse. So he figures I know what to do. The guy claims his brother is a good man and would never hurt his own child. That the mother of the child claims he sexually abused the little girl. But that she is a liar. (I will not name anyone for protective reasons.) Now he is on the side of his brother claiming the mother is crazy and a bad person. He claims she brings the child over and she is dirty and starving. That she is not well cared for by the mother.But I personally do not know her. I have however met his brother who is one of those nice guy nerdy types who hates woman and tried to say they are all bitches and cunts. He even says I am a bitch and calls me homophobic slurs. Excuse my language. I am just copying what others say. I am gender fluid, and lgbt. So personally for me I hate any kind of discrimination and hate speech.  I know what it is like to be discriminated against. I do not tolerate it well. However I do not want to be biased and say the mother is telling the truth. The problem is the child is a mute, acts out, and pisses herself. Now I have personally experienced abuse. So this child is me as a child. Only she is not disabled. Adults just assumed I was stupid and well Retarded. (Sorry if that offends anyone. But I do have cerebral palsy, and Fetal alcohol syndrome. Back in the 90’s parents said shit like that.So did other asshole kids.)That is pretty much what they said about me growing up. But this child has no known disabilities. Shows classic signs of being sexually abused. So I just feel very conflicted. I am a parent myself and if that was my child I would be freaking the F out and yeah I would be trying to figure out who messed with my child. Children do not just stop talking and act out for no reason. I might have been disabled and yeah I had trouble socializing. But I did not piss myself because I was stupid, and I certainly was not mute at school because I was stupid. I just was afraid that anything I said was gonna be called a lie or that I was gonna be called retarded or stupid. Now I can not shut up lol! I also did a lot of really stupid shit for attention because I was being neglected at home and mentally abused as well. So I sat in my room crying for a while, and I still do not know what to say to him. When I told my family that my aunt put her hand up my shirt half of them refused to believe me. Because she called me delusional and crazy. And she says I am mentally ill. I am depressed and have anxiety. Not a lot of people have seen her while she was not sober: and she denies everything. So of course people are gonna believe her. My birth dad and my uncle however know she slept with her sister in law while drunk. So at least they are on my side. But I know how hard it is to believe someone you love and care about would do something sick and disgusting. I did not even want to believe she was a bad person. So when she claimed her ex husband abused her I believed her despite her drinking and hearing her try to seduce him all the time while drunk. (Btw she raised me, and called me her daughter). She was very manipulative and until she told me I took pictures of the bruises I did believe her. But have no recollection of that, and have no pictures of the bruises: But that’s besides the point. The point is. I told him to go to cps, and to get that child into counseling. But bedsides that I have no idea what else to say to him. I know he wants to defend his brother. And for me I personally do not know if he should. I remember being 6 or 7. I was left with a baby sitter. People trusted him. Good Christian boy who went to church. But this guy was at least twice my age and tried to convince me to have sex with him. He also told me to stay quit and that if I tell he would get in trouble. I did not tell anyone until I was a teenager. I kept my mouth shut. And when I was caught with my pants around my ankles in front of the neighbor boy and his brother I was punished for it and they where not. Despite the older brother being almost a adult. So I know how it is. I know parents do not want to believe their child has been abused. Nobody wants to believe a child has been abused. But I can not let a child go through that. I can’t. If she was my child I would probably want to tear someone’s throat out honestly. My son is not even allowed to go near half my family. I gave up custody of him just so he was safe. I know even if someone seems to be a good person, and you love them they can still hurt you and still do bad things. I know from personal experience that some people will go to any length to lie and pretend they are not a bad person and predator. Because that is my aunt. Again sorry this was so long. I just want advise for advise. I know that is weird. But I am very emotional and I have a very hard time talking to people when I am emotional. I just want to know more about what he can do legally, and how he can protect this child. As his uncle I know he can legally act as a parent or guardian because I was raised by my aunt and uncle. I know he is a good man. His brother I do not know as well. But he has always been very good with my son, and my son calls him his uncle. I think the best option is for him to take over caring for the child honestly. If the mother is really a unfit parent as he says she is I think that is best. However I do not know if what he says is true, or just what his brother told him.  if it is then neither of the parents are suitable.  Because his brother is biased against woman, and he is raising a daughter. I do not see that being healthy for her growing up. And if he has sexually abused her then definitely not. Ugh! I am just so frustrated. Please help.', 'Lol! My dads name is Darryll spelled like that. He is for sure a redneck, and mountain man. So stop hating on my man Daryl.

Ownard,"[""I [20M] feel like one of my closest friends [19F] uses me when things are getting rough with her boyfriend \n Hey guys,\r\n\r\nThis one is a toughie for me to put into words so I am just gonna paint the whole picture. \r\n\r\nI was having a couple beers in the garden and I was reflecting on my friends and how grateful I am to have such wonderful people in my life. My best buddy, I've know him since I was 3, we've been through thick and thin together. My boys, they've always had my back and were willing to travel 3 hours when the dude my ex cheated on me with started getting cocky and threatening me. Then I got to this girl, let's call her Jane (not a real name obviously). \r\n\r\nI've only known the girl a couple years but we've both became great friends over those years. Despite us first tip-toeing the line between friends and more for the first couple weeks, when I found out she had a boyfriend, I backed off immediately and decided that I liked this girl enough to build a close friendship with - but nothing more. She is a fantastic girl who has supported me through my PTSD after my RTA. This girl got out of bed, came to.my room in student halls and held me after I woke from my worst night terrors. I couldn't have asked for a better friend during those times.\r\n\r\nThis is a quick interlude, but early on, I gathered Janes boyfriend was a collosal jerk. I can't even remember how many times I've had that girl crying in my arms over this guy whether him ignoring her, being mean, hell the boy even cheated on her. Yet she still forgave him and continued the relationship. I personally think that he knows he can get away with it because he knows her insecurities, so does it.\r\n\r\nOne behaviour I have noticed, is that when Janes relationship gets tested, normally by his behaviour but sometimes by hers aswell - she will become a lot closer to me. For example, every so often, like once every two or three weeks, we will have a movie night and a catch up because we are generally very busy people. I've noticed that when their relationship is doing okay, we do our usual greeting hug but she will sit at the other end of the bed (student halls, I have a room with a bed and that's it). However, when their relationship is on the rocks, I've noticed she gets really snuggly into me like, borderline spooning. \r\n\r\nJust to clarify, this is not an odd thing for me. I am a very physical person and this is how I show affection. I often snuggle with my single female friends when we have the same catch ups because I am a giant teddy bear.\r\n\r\nThe conversation is different too. If they are doing good, then it is a normal catch up: what we've done, who we've seen, ask about others, you know the drill. But if it's hit bad times, she always steers the conversation towards sex.\r\n\r\nLike I say, I have only just noticed this pattern occuring and I am not sure what to make of it. At first glance, it looks like she is using me for validation when her boyfriend isn't giving it but I get the feeling that there may be more than meets the eye. I am the first person she goes to when something goes wrong, usually because I will just give her tea, a hug and listen - because I've gathered there is no point giving advice because she will do the opposite anyway.\r\n\r\nAnyway, so what do you fine folk think of my predicament? Any advice and opinions are appreciated!\r\n\r\nTL:DR - Friend gets really snuggly and talks about sex when her relationship is on the rocks but keeps a healthy distance and normal conversation when it's going good. Think I may be being used for validation but I get the feeling there may be more to it."", 'You throw out a lot of options here, so if you were to bet, which one would you put your money on?', 'Best spellcaster for a Nuke lobbing mage? \n Hey there, Looking for a spellcaster that is capable of nuking opponents with great efficiency.

ACuriousFrenchie,"[""This is the shittiest argument I've ever read. Sounds like it was written by a deep 14 years old."", 'How incel theory can be disproven using game theory \n Incel theory is internally inconsistent and can be disproven using reverse game theory\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Introduction: \r\n\r\nI was talking to a friend of mine before econ class, and somehow the topic turned to <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. So we\'re talking about them, then he says these words:\r\n\r\n""Incels are just dudes with no game.""\r\n\r\nWriting it out mathematically, the statement becomes, ""If you are an incel, you are a dude with no game"", so the <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> to give them ""game"", it would be completely ineffective, as the incel mindset is, at its core, anti-woman. At the basis of the ideology is a fundamental objectification of women, simply turning them into objects of use, and hence an incel would likely use that ""game"" to commit harm against women.\r\n\r\nSo we can\'t use ""game"", but still, how can we help incels, or at least prevent other people from believing their ideology and becoming incels themselves?\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> Teach all people reverse game theory, also known as mechanism design. \r\n\r\n<HEADING> Background: \r\n\r\nImmediately, the question is why teaching people mechanism design will help with the incel problem. This is because incel theory has a huge mechanism design flaw. \r\n\r\nSee, according to incel theory, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> simply out to use and harm men.\r\n\r\nThat is bad economics, specifically bad mechanism design. Using the aforementioned assumptions, we will prove that incel theory is internally inconsistent.\r\n\r\n<HEADING> The Model: \r\n\r\nLet\'s create the setting. We have one lady, whom we will denote as W. There are N guys who are attracted to her, and want to become her boyfriend. She will only have one boyfriend. \r\n\r\nThe key thing to note is that <ITALIC> each guy does not know how much he actually values a relationship a relationship with W. This is because W may seem great in public, but in private and in a relationship she may be completely different. Maybe she\'s just putting on an act, like incel theory states.\r\n\r\nSo the guys don\'t know their exact values (V) of a relationship with W, but they have expected values (E(V)), which are dependent on a signal (S) they each receive about W. Maybe the signal is a rumor they heard about her, an Instagram post, whatnot.\r\n\r\nWe will assume that signals are positively correlated with values. In other words, a high/low signal means it\'s more likely that a guy\'s true value of a relationship with W will be high/low. Furthermore, we will assume that each guy\'s signals and values are ""affiliated"" with the others\'. In other words, the higher other guys\' signals/values are, the more likely you will have a high signal/value. We can say that in this model, values are interdependent and not independent. Furthermore, signals are drawn from the same distribution for each guy. Finally, every guy is risk-neutral.\r\n\r\nLet\'s take the point of view of one guy who likes W, and there are N-1 other guys. We will let S denote the signal of this guy and Y<ITALIC> i denote the i-th highest signal of the other N-1 guys. So Y1 is the highest signal of the others, Y<ITALIC> 2 is the 2nd-highest, and so on, until Y{N-1} is the N-1 highest of the others, i.e. the lowest.\r\n\r\nNow let\'s use the incel assumptions to construct the mechanism that decides who becomes W\'s boyfriend. Accordingly, W is purely materialistic, shallow, and in general a bad person. She only cares about what the guys can do for her, be it buying her food, clothes, and whatnot. Hence, she will only enter a relationship with the guy who is willing to spend the most money on her (maybe there are other things she wants too, but if so let\'s just take the <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> to combine those things into one value). This means that each guy will keep trying to do the others in terms of how much they spend on her (assuming that budget constraints do not bind). As each guy declares how much money he will spend on W, this ""raises the cost"" of a relationship with W. Eventually, there will come a point where the expected utility from being in a relationship with W will be negative; this occurs for a guy when the cost is too high. And so he drops out. More and more guys drop out, until there are only 2 guys left in this spending game. Finally, one of the guys will raise the cost just too high for the other guy, and so the other guy drops out, and thus the guy who raised the cost becomes W\'s boyfriend. The cost to W\'s boyfriend is thus the point at which the second-to-last guy dropped out.\r\n\r\nYou may notice that this mechanism sounds almost exactly like W setting up an <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> in equilibrium for independent private values; specifically, the equilibrium cost at which a winner wins is the same across both auctions. However, values here are interdependent, so equilibrium is not exactly the same. However, I will examine the second-price case, because the qualitative result is the same, and it\'s also easier. Just for robustness though, we\'ll discuss how the final qualitative result holds when analyzing the English auction perspective.\r\n\r\nNow, return to the guy whose POV we are taking. Let <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> be his expected value of a relationship, condition on his signal equaling some $x$, and all the other guys\' signals being whatever they are. \r\n\r\nHowever, remember the setting! If this guy wins, he pays the cost at which the last person among the others dropped out. Furthermore, signals and values are correlated, and due to the symmetry assumption from above, we have that the highest signal equals the highest expected value of a relationship. This means that our specific guy only cares about the signal of the person with the highest signal among the others, because the cost at which that guy drops out is the cost our guy pays. So we can rewrite the condition expected value <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>, for some signal y.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will let b^*(x) denote the cost one pays if he becomes W\'s boyfriend, given that his signal is x. So in the second-price sealed bid auction setting, since we are assuming risk neutrality here, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. Let\'s draw a graph!\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nLet\'s suppose our guy shares that signal. Then his cost function will <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nNext, we\'ll graph the expected value of a relationship, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. Notice that this doesn\'t start at 0, since one\'s own signal is positive, so even if others\' signals are 0, one will have positive expected value. Right now we won\'t prove why the slope is less than that of the b function; we\'ll shiow that later. But the intuition, I think, is clear: your own signal has a higher effect on you than others\' signals, and while your own signal is constant in the expected value function, it changes with y in the b function. So the b function has a greater slope.\r\n\r\nNow, remember that all the guys are risk neutral, meaning our guy only wants to win when expected value is greater than or equal to cost, or lose when expected value is less than cost. <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. This shows that the slope of the b function is greater than that of the expected value function when S = x.\r\n\r\nAnyways, because of the previous observation, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. So, what is the ramification?\r\n\r\nWell, because of everything we have shown in the graph\'s thus far, we can define b^*(x) in terms of condition expected value: <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. In other words, for each guy, it is an optimal strategy to act as though everyone else has the same signal as he does, so as to guarantee that he drops out when the cost goes too high, but stays in when it hasn\'t reached that point yet!\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Proving the Internal Inconsistency of Incel Theory: \r\n\r\nSupposedly, it is in W\'s interest to lie and hide her true nature from the guys. But does that actually hold, assuming <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>?\r\n\r\nLet\'s say that W will also get a signal about herself. She can commit to one of two plans: Plan A is to reveal the signal, and Plan B is to not reveal the signal. Remember, her goal is to extract the largest cost out of the guys as possible. So given this objective, which plan is optimal?\r\n\r\nWell, let\'s define new variables. Let X<ITALIC> i define the i-th highest signal overall. So for example, if we take the perspective of the guy with the highest signal, then his signal is X1, but Y<ITALIC> 1 is the next-highest signal, i.e. Y1 = X_2 in this case.\r\n\r\nLet us also define S<ITALIC> W to be the signal that W can choose to revealing or not revealing. Suppose that SW = w. Then if she chooses to reveal it, a guy with signal x will act according to the above, while also taking into account W\'s signal, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nIncel theory dictates that W\'s optimal strategy is to commit to not reveal her signal. Now, you may know of the <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>, which will tell you whether or not incel theory is correct. But we will do a direct proof here. spoiler: incel theory is wrong, and it is actually W\'s optimal strategy to commit to revealing her signal.\r\n\r\nNow we know that W\'s benefit comes from the cost at which the guy with the second-highest signal drops out. So let us take the perspective of the guy with the second-highest signal.\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nNext, we will use the <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nNext, since the outside conditions have your signal and the highest among the others equal to x, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nNext, we know that we are looking from the perspective of the person with the second-highest signal, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nNow we shake things up. Suppose that the highest signal of the others is greater than or equal to x. Since all the guys\' signals and values are affiliated, it means that now, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nNext, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>, since S = X_2 = x already implies that the highest signal among the others\' is greater than or equal to x.\r\n\r\nFinally, we know we\'re looking at the guy with the second-highest signal, so <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nWhat did we just prove? Remember that the cost W gets from her boyfriend is the cost at which the guy with the second-highest signal dropped out, i.e. his reservation cost. Hence, this proof shows that the reservation cost of the guy with the second-highest signal <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>! QED.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> In other words, it is optimal for W to commit to revealing her signal, which proves that incel theory is internally inconsistent with its assumptions!\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Discussion: \r\n\r\nThe intuition is that the second-highest reservation cost underestimates the true value to that guy of a relationship with W, since the guy with the second-highest signal operates under the assumption that the highest signal among the others equals his. This is false, though, as the highest of the other signals is greater than his, and if he knew that, then his expected value would increase. Hence, by committing to revealing S_W, W corrects for this underestimate and raises, on average, the second-highest reservation cost. This is because her signal is affiliated with the highest other signal.\r\n\r\nNow let\'s loop back to the English perspective. Using the Linkage Principle, it can be proved that English case has an expected cost greater than or equal to the second-price case. Furthermore, W revealing her signal yields the same qualitative result: this is more beneficial to her than hiding her signal.\r\n\r\nHence, teaching people mechanism design will showcase this internal inconsistency in incel theory.\r\n\r\nIncel theory is bad, and now we know that not only is it bad morally, but economically as well.', 'TIL that in the 16th and 17th century, erectile dysfunction was a crime in France and was ground for divorce.

Kool-Kukumber,"['Daily Song Discussion - Gene By Gene (Think Tank) \n Looks like we’re nearly at the end of the Think Tank, and today we’re going over the penultimate track of the album, Gene By Gene. Lyrically I’m not entirely sure what Damon is going for. The only bit I really understand is Damon’s reference to producer Fatboy Slim (this is the second of two songs he produced on the album) and to the Moroccan barn where much of the album was recorded.\r\n\r\nMusically the song does show the influence of Fatboy Slim through being one of the more dance orientated tracks on the album. It is far from conventional however, as we get plenty of strange sound effects and some funk influenced guitar work that we’ve never really seen Blur utilise before. Alex and Dave again play important roles in the song, with the use of drum machines adding some electronic percussion typical of Fatboy Slim. The track once again bears an uncanny resemblance to Gorillaz however - Damon’s vocals especially are very reminiscent of his singing style on the virtual band.\r\n\r\nLyrical highlight: “Got to get into a better business, Deep down happiness”\r\n\r\nMusical highlight: Guitar work, bass work\r\n\r\nBest performers: Damon and Alex\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>', 'It’s honestly the best collection of live recordings the band ever released imo.', 'I think you could make the argument that Ballad of John and Yoko/Old Brown Shoe was the standalone single for Abbey Road - it wasn’t recorded in the same sessions but it came out only a few months before Abbey Road.', '<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.

It only pushed us further and further apart. I had a way better bond with my uncle who helped raise me. He let me get my hair cut short. He let me ride 4 wheelers. He never really seemed to care.

But growing up on the spectrum and being disabled I distanced myself from people emotionally, mentally, and physically. My aunt was a drunk, and she sexually abused me.

Young age I was different. I loved wrestling and I loved helping my uncle with his truck.\nI also mostly hung out with boys and liked getting dirty and being bossy. My aunt just assumed I was a Daddies little girl, or that I watched wrestling to check out the men. And the older I got the more I distanced myself from her. The more she pressured me into being a pretty woman or girl. The more I felt upset and hurt by her. She loved my step sister with their long blonde hair and tall skinny figures. She denied that she was bisexual or into woman despite hooking up with her sister in law while drunk. And trying to seduce me while drunk. I am not just attracted to men. But I have a very hard time bonding with woman and being comfortable with them.  I often get told I act like a guy. And I don’t feel like a man. But I feel in the middle or like I switch. And often times I dress goth and present as feminine. But I shave part of my head and I do not act feminine often. I do not see why people care about my gender or sex. To me it is trivial.

Being 10 years older, you born in \'84 and I in \'94. Being born of different fathers, your are a big sister by quite a wide margin.\r\n\r\nYou baby sat from the time I was walking. Mom and dad, being nurses, got paid more for working graveyard shifts at the hospital. They took the extra money, and you were stuck with me from 6:00 P.M. to 6:00 A.M., when mom got home. \r\n\r\nI ruined your teenage years. I\'m sorry. It\'s no wonder we were so terrible to each other for so long. You were angry and frustrated, and I retaliated. It wasn\'t unjustified. I don\'t hold a grudge, there\'s nothing to forgive, and I love you for being mom when mom was gone. \r\n\r\nYou protected me from the fighting—scooped me up, ran into the nearest room, and kept me close while be both cried and shook until the yelling and sound of breaking... whatever it was... stopped. You were a protector, a parent, where it wasn\'t your place to be one. \r\n\r\nI was a little asshole, too. I wasn\'t particularly appreciative of the things we did together, what you did to me when I stayed with you. I can\'t ignore that fact. And I\'m sorry for that, too. You still love me though, even if I was terrible to you for many years. A mother\'s love, as cliche as it may be, is what I\'d say you gave to me. \r\n\r\nWhen you moved out, got a place of your own in the city, you saved me from spending nights alone in our parents\' house. I still believe some weird shit happened in there. I remember it clearly, and I know you do, too, even if you deny it 15 years later. You kept me from being alone and scared at 8/9/10 years old. Spending nights with you playing games, watching movies, play fighting... I can\'t forgot those days/nights. You had an apartment, and eventually a house, with your then-long time boyfriend. \r\n\r\nHe was a brother to me. Six years, 5-11 years old, you two were a second mother and father.

That only proves my point. \r\n\r\n...I will never fault you for getting the hell out, moving to Texas from our home state, Missouri, to get away from the screaming and the emotional abuse, and get away from... sadly, what a bastard my ""brother"" had truly been, and a bastard your step-dad/my biological father is.\r\n\r\nYou never ""left me"". You just did the smart thing and got out. I was 11 years old. That\'s when I was alone in the house. As afraid as I was the first couple of years, developed unhealthy coping mechanisms in the mean time, I grew to love the peace and quiet, and disliked it when dad was off work.\r\n\r\n...Even when I was scared, you answered the phone, 1,000 miles away, and talked to me, calmed me down, as long as you could before you had to go to bed for work, had to leave to do something with your now-husband, whatever it was. \r\n\r\nEven 1,000 miles away..., you had not abandoned your mother-like duties to your baby sister that you\'d raised. You took me to theme parks, Disney on Ice, Laser Tag, Bowling. You disciplined me when I deserved it. You apologized when you were wrong—something mom and dad never did. We did things like a family would—you, N, and I.\r\n\r\nYou tried to ""police me"" in terms to style and shit, like mom did. Again, trying to be a mom, even when it pissed me off. I never listened, just like I never listened to mom. ""Pick your battles,"" as you both said.\r\n\r\nNow adults, we hang out, go to lunch, lounge around your house, do ""adult-y"" things. You have two kids. O is three, K a year on the 8th of July. \r\n\r\nAnd yet..., I can still come to you for help, for advice, where I know mom would blow up, or get smug with ""I-Told-You-So\'s"", knowing you\'ll be there to lend and ear and give honest feedback. \r\n\r\n...Sisi, I\'ll never call you by your first name; it\'s just weird.

With such a major revenue stream drying up almost entirely, finding ways to continue supporting artists in the coming months is now an urgent priority for anyone who cares about music and the artists who create it. The good news is that we’re already seeing many fans going above and beyond to support artists across Bandcamp.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> To raise even more awareness around the pandemic’s impact on musicians everywhere, we’re waiving our revenue share on sales this Friday, March 20 (from midnight to midnight Pacific Time), and rallying the Bandcamp community to put much needed money directly into artists’ pockets.\r\n\r\nFor many artists, a single day of boosted sales can mean the difference between being able to pay rent or not. Still, we consider this just a starting point. Musicians will continue to feel the effects of lost touring income for many months to come, so we’re also sharing some ideas below on how fans can support the artists they love and how artists can give fans new, creative ways to provide support.\r\n\r\nIt may sound simple, but the best way to help artists is with your direct financial support, and we hope you’ll join us on Friday and through the coming months as we work to support artists in this challenging time.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Ethan Diamond  \r\n<BOLD> Co-Founder & CEO  \r\n<BOLD> Bandcamp\r\n\r\n📷\r\n\r\n<HEADING>  If you’re a fan\r\n\r\nWe recognize that plenty of music fans are also seeing their livelihoods disrupted by this virus, but if you’re lucky enough to be in a position to spare some funds (or find yourself in that position in the coming months), please consider sharing your good fortune by buying music and merchandise directly from artists on Bandcamp. This Friday, March 20th, Bandcamp’s share of sales will also go to the artists and labels you choose to support, and as always, it will reach them in 24-48 hours.\r\n\r\nIf you already have all the music and merchandise you want from your favorite artists, consider discovering new favorites via our editorial publication, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> and let them make their own selections. \r\n\r\nFinally, most of the items on Bandcamp have an option to pay more than the asking price, and leave a note for the artist.

You can also use the <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> to message your followers about it.\r\n\r\nMany of your fans are actively looking for ways to support you through this crisis. Even if you don’t have new music or merch, we know fans love live recordings and early demos, and this is a good time to dig those up and release them on Bandcamp. We’re also seeing artists offering music production services, as well as video hangouts, lessons, and gear tutorials (these can all be listed as merch items on Bandcamp). Over the coming weeks we’ll collect examples of what’s working best and share those here, so if something is especially effective for you or you’re just excited about an idea, please [let us know](mailto:supportingartists@bandcamp.com).\r\n\r\nP.S. Many others within the music industry are being impacted as well, including record store owners and staff, tour managers, event producers, venue staff, lighting and sound professionals, janitors, photographers, bartenders, security guards, and more.

You\'ll always have bad faith actors. You\'ll always have fetishizers posing as allies who will use any buzzword in order to conceal their true intentions that they only want to objectify trans women. Chasers are gonna chase. My point is that your concerns for objectifying chasers would still exist regardless if the word ""transamory"" existed or not.  \r\n\r\n\r\n In a way I also wish that a word like “transamory” didn’t need to exist, just like I wish the word ""atheist"" didnt exist either. There really shouldnt be a word to describe a non-belief  just like there isnt a word to describe people who dont have a particular hobby. Likewise why should there be a special word to describe a mere relationship between a man and a woman? Trans women are women right? And love is love correct? I wish it were that simple and easy, but unfortunately I don’t see us there yet. Cis and trans relationships are still scrutinized very much. Thats why many cis people are still quiet about their attractions. That wont change until there are more people open with their attractions and more trans acceptance from the general public.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI understand that being in a relationship with a trans woman means I will not fit the heteronormative role most other cis men like me colloquially ascribe to. I know in most instances my relationship with my girlfriend will not be accepted at face value for what it is so I know I will find myself constantly trying to validate my relationship to others. In this respect I find the word “transamorous” useful in making my cis friends and acquaintances understand my relationship with my girlfriend.   \r\n \r\n\r\nAgain I understand your concerns against the term though. I know you want to be seen as women and not as something “other.” I know you certainly don’t want to be fetishized. Its obviously a word I would not use to describe myself if Im in a conversation with other trans people. I know trans women are women. I keep the term “transamorous” at arms length sort of speak because of that. I want to respect the identities of trans women as women while being able to embrace my own identity of who I am without limiting my individuality and compelling myself to dissimulate or sublimate who I am and who I am attracted to.', 'A friend of mine said the same thing lol', 'Well I mean did you ever consider the fact that youre wrong ad that you are trying to argue from simplified version of a nuanced truth which was never expanded upon as you grew up?  \r\n\r\n\r\nNow you want to appeal to an irrational concern of mistaking someones gender or a hyperbolic false equivalency of people thinking theyre a different animal. In the first case its ok to make a mistake at first try. It only becomes a problem when you continually misgender someone after they tell you which pronouns to use. The second case is just utter ridiculousness not worth any serious merit. Again look at ones gender not merely on a notion of feeling but also as an expression of ones self.']",M

It's tough sometimes but we gotta focus on us and people who show evidence of really caring."", ""I just had the best gender-affirming dream. \n Warning: slightly sexual/NSFW. So, I know being a man does not revolve entirely around having a cock but that's always been kind of an important imagery/feeling/concept to me. Thankfully, when I'm not looking at myself I never feel as if I have some kind of 'female' parts there.\r\nBut then, I had this dream, and I <ITALIC> did have a cock, and it WAS physically real, and I could hold it and everything...I'd gone shopping for and bought some kind of dick pump. It wasn't fitting properly, I just kept messing with it and it was visibly fairly empty compared to what it should've been. It was an opaque cylinder so you could see parts of it if you took it off to see. Then, this guy who was conveniently next to me (who I realized had no clue I was FTM, like I literally even passed IN the dream that much that he never even questioned it) was helping describe how to make it work best. So (maybe kind of NSFW, feel free to leave) it did manage to grip on properly, and literally I could see and feel it grow somehow the way I wanted it to all along after a couple more minutes of fiddling. And it was...huge. Like, appropriately- sized dick to what I've always wanted it to be and everything, I could hold it and feel it in my hand and that's all that I did with it, but it felt so right and so amazing.\r\n\r\nThe bittersweet part is I had a friend there. They are non-binary and one of my friends who truly understands my gender and accepts it maybe the most out of a lot of people, although I love and appreciate any of my friends who do. Well they saw me doing this and were probably even more shocked than I was. Like, impressed kind of shocked. And I wasn't trying to show off or anything. I just happened to be enjoying the moment at the time. It's bittersweet because not too long ago I was having feelings for them. I had to kind of squash all that cause they are dating and that took some time for me to get over and process, as silly as it may have been. I could actually picture us being together at different points which doesn't happen with just anyone. Without rambling too much more, the lesson I learned from that was a very positive one. My last few relationships that had ended, I largely thought were my fault for big mistakes I had made, or that they werent the right ones and I worried for a long time I'd never be 'good enough' to be with someone forever and I would probably mess it up in some way. Loving my friend opened my eyes to the fact that in a relationship, I actually have a lot to offer now in terms of being a good partner - caring for them, and doing anything for them, and making the odd sacrifice just to see them happy. \r\n\r\nI was cuddling with my friend afterwards in the dream (fully clothed) and also happened to be on top of them...anyway right after the highlight of that dream they were kissing me and told me they love me. I kissed them back, trying to enjoy it even knowing that I did care for them (maybe not full on love like I imagined it was) even knowing that's not real and that this part of the dream in specific was not real/genuine. They kept talking to me, just telling me some cute stories and stuff after that until I woke up...\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it was a very bittersweet dream. I had a few tears after that and I still feel like crying to be honest. It felt so right and knowing that I won't necessarily have a cock like that, of course it's at least a little upsetting and I wish I could've spent even longer in that moment of the dream, for as long as I wanted, even if it's not real. I've been going through a rough patch lately mental health wise in some ways and living in a house where my gender is not acknowledged either but this made me feel so good about myself and is something I will treasure for a long time.\r\n\r\nI think the stuff about my friend pretty clearly says how I felt about them or the things I saw possibly happening down the road - they could come around years from now but I wouldn't care to know that nor would I ever push it at this point either. I'd have a lot of work to do on myself before probably either of us could be together...but that's not the point. Clearly somewhere in my mind this dream has expressed some difficult feelings I was dealing with before that they'd like me more if I was a cis guy. I don't believe this was what the dream was about, and the person who I do end up with IRL will have to love all parts of me just like they will invetably love our intimacy and my cock in whatever shape it's in. That was merely a bittersweet part of the dream, and thankfully I am close enough with that friend that I felt comfortable sharing part of it with them. The part specifically of the experience of having a cock at least, haha. \r\n\r\nI hope anyone who hasn't had something like this can have it. I've had similar dreams before but my male side often doesn't come out SUPER strong like that or in such a realistic way. I'd been having strange dreams lately so I think I knew something was coming but...wow, that was a nice surprise.\r\n\r\nEdit: fixed some awkward choice of wording."", ""I'm just going to 'borrow' the one on the left...if you include Yuri it'll still be three houses anyway :P""]",M

Kool-Kukumber,"['Daily Song Discussion - Beetlebum (S/T) \n I’m starting the song discussions back up, and the song we’re looking at first was perhaps the most important song Blur had put out to that point, the opening track and lead single of the self titled album, Beetlebum. This song marked the first sign of a drastic change in Blur’s music, and taking a look at the lyrics you can definitely see the evolution occurring. For one of the first times in Blur’s discography Damon directly calls upon his own experiences when constructing lyrics, as the song describes his heroin addiction and drug experiences with Justine Frischmann. \r\n\r\nMusically the song is as dark as the lyrics, and act as a stark contrast to the bright and sunny sound we’ve heard on Blur’s previous albums. One thing that hasn’t changed however is Graham’s guitar wizardry; his eclectic playing once again anchors the song, and his Beatle-esque backing vocals work fantastically alongside Damon’s. \r\n\r\nReleased as a single on January 20, 1997, the song defied fears from Blur’s record label that it would dent Blur’s popularity, as the song became their second number 1 single on the UK Singles Chart.\r\n\r\nLyrical highlight: “I just slip away and I am gone”\r\n\r\nMusical highlight: Guitar playing\r\n\r\nBest performer: Damon, Graham\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>', 'Yeah it’s a real shame. According to the video’s comments the only reason Alex even played it here was because Andy was having technical difficulties with his bass, and Alex just decided to fill the time by performing a song they hadn’t released yet.', ""Daily Song Discussion - Song 2 (S/T) \n Well this next song doesn’t require much introduction; Song 2 is the infamous second track and second single on the self titled album, and perhaps exists as one of the most misunderstood and ironic songs to reach high levels of popularity. Intended as a parody of grunge, the lyrics of the song make no sense, and are a intentional dig at grunge bands such as Nirvana who would use strange and unrelated phrases to construct their lyrics. In this way the lyrics came off as hilarious, and yet they work surprisingly well with the music, especially that classic “Woo-hoo!” refrain.\r\n\r\nMusically the song is unlike anything Blur have done so far. Alex’s bass guitar is distorted to a large degree and Graham’s meticulous guitar work is thrown out the window in favour of a much simpler, yet very pulsating approach. Dave’s drum work here also gives the song its heavy nature, and his drum introduction is one of the most iconic parts of the song.\r\n\r\nFittingly, the song reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, and was a surprise hit in the United States, reaching number 6 on the US Alternative Songs chart. It remains easily Blur’s biggest hit in the US and much of the world, despite not accurately representing much of the band’s sound.\r\n\r\nLyrical highlight: “I got my head checked, By a jumbo jet, It wasn't easy, But nothing is, no”\r\n\r\nMusical highlight: Guitar work, bass work, drum work\r\n\r\nBest performers: Damon, Graham, Alex and Dave\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>"", 'If I may ask how were you able to see inside Studio 2?

redxrain86,"['Who even needs the woman on the left?', 'For sure!

anaburo,"['YES!! No matter what instrument you’re playing, 50% of technique is injury prevention. With scream vocals, is more like 75. A scream sesh will wear out your clean voice just a liiiiiitle bit, so if your cleans feel weak after screaming, you’ve got some adjustments to make. \n\nYou need to be in touch with you lungs. I recommend (soon) doing screams that you’re comfortable with, at a medium volume, for an entire tank of air, focusing on not letting the sound change as your supply dwindles. \n\nRELAX! If you must carry tension, do your very best to limit it to facial muscles. Your diaphragm should be engaged, but everything in your arms, chest, shoulders, and most importantly neck, should all be nice and relaxed. Seizing up doesn’t just open you up to different strains, doesn’t just restrict your control over your sound, it’s also subconsciously very distracting for your body, having so much extra to do all at once. \n\nLast up, mixing natural voice into your sound is NOT a beginner technique. When you feel comfortable with your chosen method of dirt production, you can start experimenting with the mixed sound, but do so JUST AS CAREFULLY as your first week screaming (5min/day for the first week, 10 for the second). It’s very easy to shake the actual voice too hard and damage the folds. The clean voice test from above is great for this too. \n\nRemember, this lovely little art form we do here, it’s inherently goofy. You’re trying to sound like a demon for hecks sake. The driving emotion should be joy and amusement, not rage. In fact, please do your best to never scream when you’re actually angry, it’s far too easy to be careless.', 'Thanks!

ZeroReverseR1,"['Level Eater: A Short Idea on a Possible Errata \n <HEADING> Foreword\r\n\r\nJust to get it out of the way, I\'m well aware of how Level Eater can be abused in the Link Format, since you can have a LV5+ sugar daddy for it to feed off of and keep coming back as material. I also wanna mention that I <ITALIC> don\'t run (nor need to run) Level Eater in any of my current decks, so I\'m not really desperate to be able to use it again.\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Background\r\n\r\nSo I found myself thinking about how this little bug boi could come off the banlist, and seeing how Links have made their mark in the game, an errata is going to be inevitable if there\'s any hope for it to be legal again without breaking things. Doesn\'t help LV5+ monsters are much easier to bring than ever before, so you\'ll almost always have something for it to bite from.\r\n\r\nOf course, erratas are usually frowned upon for a variety of reasons. Some have been changed/nerfed so much that they\'ve lost what made them them (e.g. Dark Strike Fighter), with some saying they should\'ve just stayed banned at full power rather than defeat the purpose of them coming back out as a shadow of their former selves. There\'s also the fact that older versions of the card, especially for more significant effect changes (e.g. Sangan being HOPT), may not be usable in less casual events.\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Idea\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I was thinking if Level Eater could be errata\'d to simply be unusable as Link Material if summoned by its own effect. Yes, it kills interaction with the modern format, but it does prevent the possible abuse without affecting the way it\'s been used before.\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Problems\r\n\r\nDark Synchro: Thought I forgot they existed, huh? I\'m aware they\'re part of the reason Level Eater got banned due to allowing for Omega loops and ending on a board full of Quasars/Blazars, since I used to play a little bit of Dark Synchros way back when myself, though I know not all variants required Level Eater. What I don\'t know is if they can still blow off even in the Link Format (never tried), and with almost every other combo piece also hit (Gofu, Omega, etc.).\r\n\r\nFuture Proofing: Of course, this errata would only help solve Link abuse, and would make it very obvious why they banned and errata\'d it (it\'s like if Yata Garasu got errata\'d to specifically say ""cannot be used if you activated the effect of Chaos Emperor Dragon this turn""). If Konami introduces another summoning method or gimmick where the great minds of the community could find ways to abuse the poor insect, then that\'s a whole other story.\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Possible Alternatives\r\n\r\nThere are some other, albeit worse, ideas I had in mind that could happen:\r\n\r\n* Not usable as Link Material <BOLD> at all, even if not summoned by its own effect\r\n\r\n* Banished when it leaves the field after using its effect\r\n\r\n* Once per Turn (Hard or Soft)\r\n\r\n* Can\'t bite from the same monster more than once\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Going Forward\r\n\r\nThis got me thinking about future erratas, not just Level Eater\'s, and how they could be handled better. Of course, it won\'t be applicable to all cards currently on the list, as there are definitely some that\'ll require heavier changes, but I\'m sure there are ways for others that let them keep the full power they had during their time without completely tipping the scales of the modern format.\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Discussion\r\n\r\nSo, what does everyone else think? Would you be fine if the errata was just that (or would it even solve the problem), or would you rather it stay untouched? Would you want other cards to be errata\'d provided they don\'t butcher the effect but still keep it from being abused somehow?\r\n\r\nAlso, any problems I failed to consider with Level Eater\'s hypothetical return, or reasons why it was banned that I missed? I\'m sure there are some since I\'m not too well-versed on maintaining format health and whatnot. Maybe no one else even misses/wants Level Eater to come back, I dunno.', 'Executor suffers an identity crisis so hard he just blows up.', ""Definitely interesting that DLM still holds Crystrons in such high regard. I love them and play them exclusively, don't get me wrong, but while I do agree their ceiling hasn't changed, I feel like Tier 2 is the best spot for them. Either because I don't think they're super strong, or because I don't want them to be in the spotlight for Konami to hit.\r\n\r\nI do agree that the worst that's happened is the loss of semi-limited cards like World Legacy Clash and E-Con, and that can be worked around relatively easily with other techs (good thing I got Machina Fortress before since I had a feeling I might need it one day in Crystrons). Losing 1 Rion makes little difference since you can just add 1 more Citree now that NMCR's been nerfed. I might also consider Cosmic Cyclone now since I'm expecting to see a rise in AFD>Necrovalley users.\r\n\r\nThe hit to TC does kinda suck for the consistency, but Undine acts as a substitute, and since you were already playing 1-2 garnets in the form of the Crystal Beasts, playing 1-2 Controllers makes little difference.\r\n\r\nQuestion now is the Skill; Tunermorph and the Level Changing skills are tempting and can lead to some spicy plays, but I was also thinking about more offensive Skills like Beatdown or The Tie That Binds. WLC really helped against big beaters like Sabre Dancer without needing to do the Ametrix/Impact play, and losing it means I might struggle a bit more against raw attack."", 'While I too hate NMCR and want it to be nerfed, I personally don\'t think it\'s cheating or anything. Maybe it is abusing poor design choice by the devs, but for me, even if I don\'t use it (I don\'t even have it), anything <ITALIC> in the game is fair game (not <ITALIC> fair fair, but ""it\'s not hacking"" fair). And this is as someone who plays Crystrons exclusively.\r\n\r\nFunnily enough, I have a good record against NMCR users because they rely so heavily on it, DM players even CC\'ing their own Circle because I didn\'t set any backrow, which ends up hurting them more since I went for the Rion-banish setup rather than Citree-GY.\r\n\r\nOf course, I can\'t say the same for every deck, and some get totally shut down harder than Crystrons because they don\'t have alternative plays, which will definitely seem more unfair to them. Again, I still do think it should get nerfed and agree with you completely in that regard, but I also believe there are ways to play around it as of now.']",M

Achemar,"['""Who talks?"" A commentary on Roblox chat systems \n In Roblox, one of the key features of the platform lies in it\'s chat system. It gives players the capability to communicate and discuss with each other in-game. This chat system, however, was not always as available as it is now. \r\n\r\nIn 2014, Roblox begin to experiment with letting all players chat. I remember being younger, and all of a sudden having a strange box full of a ton of messages from strangers appear in my top left corner. I had never even known this was a feature. All I knew, was Super Safe Chat.\r\n\r\nThe new chat, available to all players, was now dubbed Safe Chat (when regarding the new, younger players able to communicate). In those days, the filter was restrictive, but still lenient enough to warrant conversation. It was still new, and had much time to be improved on. \r\n\r\nRoblox was still small, having a third of active users now present today. When I found a server of people, I\'d almost always type ""Who talks?"". It was the pseudo-replacement of ""Wanna be friends?"" as it immediately introduced you to the other players, and defined you as another one of them.\r\n\r\nOver time, however, the use of ""Who talks?"" gradually declined, as people got increasingly familiar with the new chat system and you could see this as soon as you joined. This trend lasted for many years. However, it was soon to go south.\r\n\r\nRoblox chat is a feature, it expands upon gameplay, and provides another input, this time, to the other players. When a feature goes unused or costs more than it gives, it is removed. This can be seen with the Forums, Tix, and others. I want you to go into a random game on the front page, and see how active the chat is. \r\n\r\nI recently tested this out, and went into Lifting Simulator 3. Not much to my surprise, the only chat was one person repeatedly spamming ""NO KILL"" over and over. By the time I had joined, however, this player had left and no new chats were being made. I say for 5 minutes, and only one message had been said.\r\n\r\nI also went into Adopt Me for 3 minutes, and the only people chatting were two Russian people, back and forth, in Russian. The server had some odd 35 people in it.\r\n\r\nThe places where you see chat used frequently tend to be poor roleplaying games, or niche games with strong communities. But many of these don\'t bring in as much money as other games (think Lifting Simulator or Jailbreak). \r\n\r\nIf this trend continues, we may see Roblox start to put chat in the hands of the developers, instead of providing it automatically. While unlikely this is something we must consider, because, today, when I ask ""Who talks?"", I get no answer.', 'Excuse me what? Please list, I have seen a lot of videos of the game and it seems absolutely lovely.', ""It's just a custom skybox. He managed to balance lighting out right and put the sun in a nice position.

You'd need to immediately go into a high level Synchro during <ITALIC> your turn just to get rid of it, assuming it doesn't get flipped by another Floodgate or Canadia right after.\r\n\r\nThat's also part of the reason why I think a second Lancea is a good idea; in addition to preventing Invocation from using my monsters and banishing Aleister for the recycle, I also have a back-up Tribute Summon that can thankfully tribute itself next turn. <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.

Especially a wrestlemania moment. Without them, it's difficult to do right and the energy is just gone. And it won't make much of a difference for the audience at home either.

And Drew won't be getting that. This is not something that can go off half cocked. If Vince pulls the trigger on McIntyre, his reign is gonna be a flop. I'm certain everyone's on the same page with that. \r\n\r\nLesnar needs to win this. A hard fought, skin of his teeth win, but a win nonetheless. Let him need three or more F5s to win.

Have Brock finally hit that shooting star press! Heck, we can even have the fight end in a draw with neither man able to answer a ten count. \r\n\r\nDrew is over enough that he can endure a loss and build himself back up. Have him win MiTB. Have him announce a cash in at SummerSlam or even the first show WWE has fans at. I know Vince and co. aren't great at thinking long term, but this is where they need to play the long game.

I saw some people I recognized - friends, classmates, etc. - and a bunch of people I didn't recognize. Throughout it, there were people standing up, walking around, talking, and generally having a good time.\n\nAt one point, someone I didn't know stood up, started walking walking around, and tripped and fell. Somehow, both of their eyes were... Punctured? Crushed? I'm not sure. They were pronounced dead instantly (by one random person, not necessarily a doctor). Someone took charge, led a miniature funeral, and I'm not sure what happened with the body.\n\nThis same sequence happened two more times, both people dying in the same way, in the same spot. Both were strangers. The third time, the body was propped up, and I was able to see that the eyes were practically missing, just hollow, bloody sockets. I looked away, we said a quick prayer, and then my brother's alarm clock woke me up.\n\nAt one point between the second and third deaths, the serving table ran out of food and only had things like ketchup, Sriracha, salsa, and other red condiments. One of my friends tried putting a bit of all of them on his plate, mixing them together, and dipping a leftover french fry into it. I don't know how it was, because the third death happened as he was dipping the fry.\n\nEdit: I didn't get a good look at the first two, but it seemed like the first was a man, and I'm not sure about the second. The third was a woman.\n\nEdit: background info"", 'For a minute I thought this said ""I am the only cis person"" and I was real confused until I realized it said trans <ITALIC> enough']",F
HellNoMIL,"['Did you know that the vagina is a muscle? \n\nThere are 3 types of muscle tissue:\n1. Skeletal \n2. Smooth\n3. Cardiac \n\nThe vagina is made up of skeletal muscle tissue because the vagina is not the heart or a structure controlled involuntarily. (Like veins or your stomach) \n\nThe vagina is like other skeletal muscles that are controlled voluntarily (abs, biceps). Muscles grow and strengthen with use. And atrophy if not used. So like lifting weights, sex actually increases the muscle tone of the vagina. The more someone works out their vagina through prolonged and rhythmic muscle contractions during sex and orgasm; the tighter a vagina will contract around a penis. \n\nSome men claim through anecdotal evidence that they have felt a different in tightness between a Virgin and a woman who has had sex. No scientific evidence supports these claims. Although these stories are easily explained by anxiety that a Virgin may feel during their first experience. Nerves cause a woman to tense up (flexing that vagina muscle) and will not be as naturally lubricated.  A woman who is not nervous and is ready for sex will be wet, less friction, and initially has a relaxed vagina allowing for easier entrance. \n\nI hope this explains why exactly your statement is fundamentally incorrect when considering human biology', 'That’s how everyone else learns, just some people learn faster than others lol', 'Also I don’t get why they lie?

Counter-offers won't be a problem for me because it's not really about the money in regards to my resignation, but me saying something like that (or wanting to explore new paths for my career) might rub them the wrong way. So yeah, I wanted to ask if:\r\n\r\n* Can they delay my resignation by saying one of the executives (e.g. president, general manager) isn't present, and we need to wait for them first? (Does it even need to reach executive level when I'm not even in management?)\r\n\r\n* Can they reject my reason for resigning if it doesn't satisfy them? (Do I even need to explain it completely? Of course, I need to say something, but do I need to say everything?)\r\n\r\n* Can they say that I'm still involved in some big projects and can't leave until I finish them? (Even if there's someone I can turn them over to, in addition to the fact that my 1 month notice is exactly so that they can find a replacement?)\r\n\r\nTo make matters a bit worse, my team leader will be on leave when I give my 1 month notice, but he agreed to sign my letter before he flies (he's also cool with me quitting even if I'm his right hand man). I'm actually going to prepare 5 original copies each to be signed individually as opposed to photocopying. So, in addition to that, can they say that he needs to be here physically before I can resign, even if he's already read, approved, and signed my resignation letter?\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\nBig thanks in advance for any help.

My friends have met her however but do not know she is trans (at least they havent told me yet). I have admitted to my friends that I am ok with dating a trans women in the past before I met my current girlfriend however.\r\n\r\nWere still early in our relationship. Its only been a couple of months. But Ill admit Im falling very hard for her.\r\n\r\n I know I will be ridiculed for being with a trans woman but I dont care. I knew that was a factor going in. I still feel that is sucks however that people will scrutinize my sexuality or worse misgender my girlfriend. Im afraid a lot in my family will not understand. I feel like so many people will scrutinize our relationship.   \r\n\r\n\r\nI feel though that often strengthens our bond between each other, because we will probably only be able to rely on ourselves and nobody else. In fact I believe so many people in my family circle will hope that we fail or even try and contribute to that happening.

I honestly can’t imagine that I would try to pressure a person I love and/or respect into sex, when they don’t want to. I would feel like a monster. Why is it not the same for men? Why do they think it’s okay to pressure and push a woman into sex, until they get it? How can they enjoy sex, knowing the other person only said “yes” to not disappoint them?\n\nIt is not only something that I have experienced personally, but it’s like every single one of my girl friends has as well. It’s really as if men who understand “no” and respect it fully, are in the minority.\n\nAnd I don’t think that it’s because most men are disgusting rapists by nature, ofcourse not.. I believe it comes from their upbringing. And the fact that society seems to find it “ok” ...It seems to find it bad, but not bad enough to focus on. Bad enough to joke about, but not bad enough to call out and condemn such behaviour.\n\nIt’s a small example but notions like “boys will be boys” are to blame. It sounds cliché, because we’ve read this 200 times already on Instagram and what not. But it’s true. \nIt is an irresponsible and dangerous thing to say. How will a boy grow up into a respectful and compassionate man, when all his wrongdoings were dismissed as “boys will be boys” , and he never got held accountable for not respecting somebody’s boundaries as a child? \n\nIt’s honestly disgusting.

LonelyHampster,"['[discussion] Why does my Male dog act like a mother dog towards his stuffed sloth? \n He cuddles them, nuzzles them, and he licks them. He also carries them around Lind of like a mother dog would carry her puppies. His favorite toy is a sloth. He will chew on her some. But he mostly prefers to just cuddle with her and lick her. He is half chihuahua and half rat terrier. I got him at 1 years old. He came from a hoarding house. I really don’t know much else. Other than he is sensitive about his tail and paws being touched as well. I kind of get the sense he might have been mistreated and abused. He is very attached to me, and does not like when I leave. He is slightly protective of me. And a bit protective of balls. He has never bitten anyone, or another dog. But he will bark at them to let them know to back off. I know chihuahuas can be a bit stand offish. But he is very friendly towards other humans, and most dogs. He is just protective of toys at times. But loves the warm comfort of a soft plush toy. He even cuddles with my big panda I have on the bed. He knows not to chew on it. He acts very feminine for a male dog. It does not bother me.

Maybe you do not like it but nobody is forcing you to do anything. And I never force anyone into anything. They always say yes and have control themselves. If they say no then I stop. Again you are making assumptions about what kind of dominant I am. Bdsm is not always about pain and not always about humiliation. And some people the only way they can feel good is in those ways. I can not have a normal relationship because I was abused growing up. I was sexually abused. It is all about healing and bonding for me. I am not abusing people. Abusing people is hurting people when they do not have a choice and when they are clearly not into it. I do not do that and do not tolerate that.  When I am doing bdsm my partner does not scream or cry. They moan and experience joy. If you think that is wrong I do not know what to tell you.  I would never tell someone they are wrong for enjoying intimacy. But you probably just see sin and hate. But it is not about anger. It has nothing to do with hate.

I’d know it was my room, and this wasn’t it.  All the nerdy decorations were gone, it looked like it had before I moved in. I heard the doorknob jiggled and the door opened, and the girl that entered looked incredibly familiar. \n\n“Who the hell are you?!” She screamed, and ran right back out the door, most likely to get her parents or somebody.\n\n“Oh, just what I needed.” I said to myself and I jumped out the window, because, I reasoned, that if this is in fact a version of my house, there will be a short fall to the bushes directly below. I was correct, and as I landed, my headphones flew out of my ears. I landed in the bushes, the phone, in an otter case thank god, landed a few feet away. Clambering to get out of the bushes before the girl came outside with somebody; I ran and scooped up the phone. I ran as far away as my feet would carry me, which was downtown. It was all familiar but, again different, as if in a slightly less modern time period. I slowed down and caught my breath, it was at this point I remembered that I had fallen asleep to [a RWBY x SAO mashup]( <LINK>), an odd thing to fall asleep to but, hey I was tired. It was also storming oddly hard that night, cracks of lightning and rolls of thunder kept denying me sleep. When I finally fell asleep, I remember clearly, for some reason, that the words of the song said “This’ll be the day we open up the door.” My thoughts were broken by the girl and at least 2 other people running past the alleyway I was resting in, I only got a quick glimpse of the trio but It looked like the 2 other people were… dressed up as knights?! I poked my head around the corner, and they definitely dressed like knights, they went the whole nine yards too, with metal plating and everything! I could tell because they metallically clanked and clacked.\n\n“You don’t look like you’re from around here…” said a voice from behind me.\nI quickly spun around and it was guy dressed like a knight! I couldn’t see his face but I knew he was eyeing me suspiciously. \n\n“Uh… What, of course I am!” I responded after a moment, hoping I could talk my way out of this situation. \n\n“Uh-huh, sure you are, and what am I supposed to make of your clothes, they’re a wizard’s garb, and this isn’t a wizard village.” The knight returned coolly.\n\n<ITALIC> “Wizards? Did I hear him right? And he said that my everyday clothes were a wizard’s garb… Maybe that’s why she freaked out…”\n\n“Did you hear me?” The knight asked, “I told you to explain yourself.”\n\n“Oh, right, yeah, about that…” I stepped backwards towards the other end of the alley, “I’ve got a few errands to run for the, er… Wizard college here in town, and they’re really important.” \n\n“Uh-huh, sure they are,” He took a step towards me, closing the distance, “There isn’t a wizard college around here for miles, the only ones here in America are in Washington and Rhode Island.”\n\n<ITALIC> “Shit, shit, shit. This is baaad, not only does this guy think I’m suspicious but I just failed the bluffing check!”\n\nI took another step backwards and instinctively reached for my phone, and whipped it out. The knight took a surprised step backwards but realized it wasn’t something I could hurt him with. For some ungodly reason, I unlocked my phone and the [Stardust Crusaders theme]( <LINK>) started playing. In wave of confusion, the knight retreated several steps, and reached for his sword. The reason why presented itself and [[Star Platinum] itself]( <LINK>) stepped from behind me towards the knight. \n<ITALIC> “Alright, what the fuck.” I thought to myself, “Why the hell is [Star Platinum] here, he’s a stand, not even a character.”\n\nAt this point [Star Platinum] began rushing the knight, while the knight swung wildly at him, and the knight couldn’t keep up with [Star Platinum]’s speed and power and, with one punch, knocked the knight straight out of the alleyway. He tumbled into a trash can. I paused the music on my phone and ran the exact opposite way.', 'Act 3!

Most recently, my psychiatrist prescribed me a medication for dementia because we have really run out of options. I've had horrible reactions to many of these meds, and the process of going through them has been extremely exhausting and discouraging. I've been told I shouldn't do ECT because I'm a college student and my future depends on how well my brain works. I've been thinking of trying ketamine, but upon more research I discovered that it really only works short term, can also have terrible side effects, and the long term effects aren't known because it hasn't been studied much. Yes,  I know this is a typical depression feeling, but I just feel really done with this all. It's like there's nothing left I can do. I'm not necessarily on the brink of suicide here but I very much want to stop trying at this. Even my therapist said that she doesn't think I can be cured by what modern medicine currently has. I'm scared that I'll never get better. Maybe I should just stop trying meds and focus on managing my life better? I don't know if that will help, and not actively trying treatments to make myself better seems like a cue to give up completely.

It’s essentially who I believe to be the strongest down to the weakest. These do not necessarily reflect who I think is going home next, and aren't scientific or insider-y. Without further ado, let's get going! (Spoilers for the entirety of the most recent episode, obviously)\n\n<BOLD> OUT - Chris\n\nLet’s begin here. It’s really sad to see Chris leave like this, especially after a great challenge showing, but mental health comes before any competition. Hopefully he’s feeling better now in the months since the show was recorded. Obviously, I’ve been critical of his performances on the show, but it’s just a reality tv show - everyone who gets here is talented enough to be here and what happens on the edited version of the show doesn’t necessarily reflect their true talent. (The limited extent of what we see is similar to just looking at a fantasy football score from an NFL player.) I wish him the best in his career and in beating what he described in the show.\n\n<BOLD> 1 - Mia (Last Week’s Rank - 1)\n\nAlright, I got a lot of criticism for this one last time around, but I really can’t justify having anyone else at the top. Another perfect performance in a challenge and another solid service. Hell, they gave her more screen time for something entirely irrelevant in facial expressions.\n\n<BOLD> 2 - Ariel (Last Week’s Rank - 9)\n\nHere’s something bold. I can’t really think of a major issue Ariel’s run into so far, and she’s been getting more screen time lately. I wasn’t sure where she stood in my ranks last week, but I’m pretty optimistic so far. It could fall right back down, but there are no glaring problems with any performances so far.\n\n<BOLD> 3 - Roe (Last Week’s Rank - 6)\n\nAnother contestant that hasn’t seen many issues inside of the services. I don’t really see her in the top three for a long-term outlook, but I think she deserves it here.\n\n<BOLD> 4 -  Gizzy (Last Week’s Rank - 3)\n\nGizzy didn’t get a ton of the spotlight during this episode, but was part of a deeply unimpressive service in the eyes of Gordon. Don’t read into her moving down too much though. It’s more because of Ariel’s emergence.\n\n<BOLD> 5 - Heather (Last Week’s Rank - 4)\n\nOuch. That was a bad showing, but I think that was more on the lack of communication from T. Still, her competition has been remarkably inconsistent, and that’s never a great thing.\n\n<BOLD> 6 - Kanae (Last Week’s Rank - 5)\n\nIt was a good challenge result for Kanae, even if it didn’t count. She struggled during service though. It’s not enough of a concern to really worry me - yet.\n\n<BOLD> 7 - Jose (Last Week’s Rank - 7)\n\nJose seems to be a good fit for the middle of the rankings - he’s been very solid.\n\n<BOLD> 8 - Motto (Last Week’s Rank - 8)\n\nOn the surface, it was a bad showing for Motto, with a terrible challenge performance. But he was part of a service team that was very good, and had his only struggle (order recital) coached personally by Gordon.\n\n<BOLD> 9 - Trev (Last Week’s Rank - 10)\n\nReally solid! In fact, if I was only basing it on this episode, he’d be top 5 or 6. But it’s not only based on this episode, and he’s been pretty average so far. The big personalities go far, though...\n\n<BOLD> 10 - Bret (Last Week’s Rank - 11)\n\nI can’t tell with Bret. Sometimes I think his fire is too much and it’ll eventually be his downfall in the show, but other times I see him in the black jackets. Really talented guy that has made some glaring errors.\n\n<BOLD> 11 - Scotley ((Last Week’s Rank - 12)\n\nWell, he was good tonight. Maybe it’s the start of a turnaround. Still though, see the Trev point in that these ranks factor in all the episodes, and he’s been pretty bad performance-wise until now.\n\n<BOLD> E - T (Last Week’s Rank - 2)\n\n“Last Week’s Rank - 2.” That about sums it up. I haven’t checked the rest of this subreddit yet, but I imagine there’s a lot of surprised folks out there. But...yeah - there was no communication and a lack of self-realization during the challenge that her dish maaaay not be up to par. Still though, Kevin and then T.

Men copy what they see in porn, and we all know porn focuses on male pleasure and not female pleasure.\nThe fact that mainstream feminism is like “you go girl, be a hoe!” doesn’t help women. It holds women back. It holds us back from realising we need to deal with traumas/insecurities and figure out where that comes from, instead of seeking validation from having sex with men. It hold us back from realising we don’t have to settle for less. It holds us back from knowing our value is NOT in how attractive we are to men.\nMainstream feminism further perpetuates the point that women are nothing but sexual bodies and should be valued on how much men they can attract and please.

It isn't meant so much for fusing from the GY, but more for giving you 2+ free Proto-Cyber Dragons by cutting your LP then using your Skill. I understand Herald of the Abyss and Cosmic Cyclone serve the same purpose with additional effects, but CFS has the benefit of being searchable with Core and not relying on your opponent (not saying cut the cards I mentioned for it, just that there are some differences).\r\n\r\nYou typically want to have CFS and Cyberload Fusion, with Core acting as substitutes for either one by searching what you're missing, as you instantly have the material for Rampage, so maximizing on them would probably be optimal. For reference, in a 5-card hand, having 3 Cores and 2 CFS gives you an 80.63% chance of opening at least 1 of them (that's roughly 4/5 games), and 3 of each puts you at 87.06%. 3 Cores and 1 CFS currently goes at 71.83%, a little less than 3/4 games. I'd say 2 CFS would be best since it gets kinda bricky at 3 and something something diminishing returns.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I think there are 2 approaches you can take with your support cards. You can go for a more counter-oriented approach with Herald of the Abyss, Floodgate Trap Hole, and Canadia, waiting for your opponent to commit to a play then interrupt them to drain them of resources before going in for the kill, OR for a more surprise swing play with Concentrating Current, Cosmic Cyclone, and other backrow removal to clear the way for your Fusions and prevent your opponent from interrupting them. While it's understandable to want to do both and cover all bases, with low limited the space is, it might help to focus on one approach.\r\n\r\nThe only card I can confidently recommend cutting from your list is Overload Fusion.

Strike up a conversation at \\[insert context here\\]!""\r\n\r\nI can see where people are coming from when they give that advice, but in practice, I think it gets really warped and ultimately predatory. People stop reading basic social cues because they\'re so laser-focused on securing a date and end up being creepy and harassing people.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I want when I\'m just trying to exist as a human being in a public space is for someone to approach me with the intention of sizing me up as a dating prospect. Being attractive in public is not an invitation, I didn\'t opt in for this, and it makes me feel unsafe and incapable of enjoying myself. It\'s a shitty position to put someone in, and it\'s like no one even considers the other person\'s experience. To them, the worst-case scenario is they get rejected. Maybe they accept it gracefully and go about their business, or maybe they get pushy, or maybe they start moping at the bar ... whatever. No matter how it goes, the recipient of this unwanted advance is now most likely Fucking Uncomfortable for an extended period of time and may very well just pack up and leave because they can\'t enjoy themselves anymore.\r\n\r\nAt least with OLD, everyone has explicitly opted in to play the dating game and you\'re not fucking up someone\'s entire day by hitting on them when they 100% do not want you to.', 'I totally understand the burnout factor! Even though I\'m pansexual, I stopped trying to match with women because I got so frustrated with how little engagement I was able to get out of them on OLD. I think I got extra annoyed because I feel like queer women need to stick together, and then I started to get paranoid that they were all actually hetero women looking for an ego boost or just curious, or maybe they were catfishers or bots or whatever. Idk, it was just exhausting.\r\n\r\nIt\'s easy to get discouraged and lower your standards because you\'re sick of looking, sick of putting in effort and getting nothing back, you\'re lonely and/or horny, etc., but if the way you find someone to date is by lowering your standards to accept their undesirable qualities, you end up dating someone undesirable. I\'ve been there a few times and now can confidently say how deeply Not Worth It that is.\r\n\r\nYour expectations are, unequivocally, NOT too high. They\'re yours, and you have a right to them. I don\'t prescribe to the idea that ""there\'s someone for everyone,"" but I do believe that there are a lot of people out there who are not compatible options and unfortunately you have to swim through a sea of people who aren\'t for you to find the people who could be.\r\n\r\nI 100% believe that you make yourself less likely to find a good mate when you lower your standards, because those standards don\'t actually go away, and all the things about that person that are sub-ideal are still going to bother you, and you\'ll end up back on the fckn apps in 4 months anyway. Better to be as picky as you need to be and find ways to enjoy being single in the meantime, which can be easier said than done but is a worthwhile endeavor either way.\r\n\r\nI also believe that getting jaded and going half-assed on your approach to OLD is vastly inferior to just stepping away and taking a break if you need it. The right person for you out there is not half-assed and will not be attracted to half-assed. To find your person, both of you are gonna need to put in the entire ass. I don\'t believe the answer is to stoop to average. Eventually, you\'re going to send a message to someone who is impressed by your thoughtfulness and genuine, engaged approach, and they\'ll give the same level of engagement and interest back, and that\'s the goal.\r\n\r\ntl;dr - This stranger on the internet validates your expectations/standards and encourages you to be your best self even when other people are slacking.

ISTJScorpio95,"['Hey, have you heard of/joined <SUBREDDIT> yet? We are currently at 398 members, just 2 away from 400! :)', 'Part 2 (A deep-dive into the multiple parallels between Glimmer and Cassandra):\r\n\r\nAfter watching most episodes twice and thinking more about it, Glimmer and Cassandra have more similarities than people realize (imo).\r\n\r\nLife experiences: Their beginnings/upbringings may be different, but what they have gone through as teenagers and young women are very similar. The way I see it, both Glimmer and Cass are women characters who are largely misunderstood, overlooked, underestimated, and underrated not just by the fans, but by other characters in their respective shows (just to name a few for both: Glimmer by Angella, Adora, Bow, and Castaspella; Cass by Rapunzel, Eugene, the Captain of the Guards, and Adira). Also, both are mainly known as “sidekicks” to the main character: Glimmer to Adora and Cass to Raps. Largely due to this, both feel a need to “step out of the shadows” and prove themselves. This can lead to far-reaching/dangerous consequences as we can clearly see in both series. For example, both are easily manipulated/gaslighted by shady figures: Glimmer by Shadow Weaver and Cass by Zhan Tiri. Basically, both Glimmer and Cass’ actions are driven by good intentions, but can end up having bad impacts (a very relatable aspect to me). Finally, both Glimmer and Cass have wielded/used the full power of their in-universe’s version of the Moonstone, confirming they have strong affinities with the Moon/lunar-related powers.\r\n\r\nPersonality: Both Glimmer and Cass are brave, strong, tough, and smart women who are also temperamental/hot-headed and stubborn/headstrong. At their core, they are fighters who never give up. Both women have persistence, perseverance, and resilience that is unrivaled when compared to other characters. Case in point, Glimmer and Cass have that “stubborn courage”/“determinator” attitude as they are facing opponents in battle (which we see many examples of in both series): when the going gets tough, they will keep on fighting until they can’t any longer (this is a winning attitude in my book).\r\n\r\nPhysical appearance: Both Glimmer and Cass are fairly short women (around 5 feet tall or so) with short hair in a “bob-style”. Additionally, both have/had “unnaturally colored irl” hair. In five seasons of <ITALIC> SPoP, Glimmer has pink/purple hair with sparkles. Meanwhile, Cass’ hair was turquoise blue at the end of S2 and during S3 of <ITALIC> TTS/RTA. Going even further, Cass and Glimmer have notable costume changes as their own series progresses, signifying dynamic character development. Cass does have more wardrobe/outfit changes than Glimmer, but my point still stands.\r\n\r\nSexual Orientation: Based on evidence throughout both series and posts by show staff on social media, it is safe to say that Glimmer and Cass are LGBT+ women. Glimmer appears to be bisexual because she has shown interest in both women (i.e., cuddling with Adora in a Mystacor spa, kissing Catra on the cheek, and hugging both women) as well as men (her friendship with Bow that became a romantic relationship as the hugs turned to kisses over time). Even though it was never confirmed in <ITALIC> TTS/<ITALIC> RTA itself, I think we can definitely infer that Cass is LGBT+. Now, whether Cass is lesbian or bisexual is currently up for debate, because while she has shown an interest in men (which may have actually been a ruse), she seems to be much more interested in women (specifically Rapunzel), even though it may be an intense unrequited/one-sided type of love.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the parallels between Glimmer and Cass are numerous.\r\n\r\nThese are just the ones that I can remember off the top of the head.', 'This is a poll question. Just want to make sure that people who see this know (you may need to go back and come back again/refresh your screen).', 'Same here! Glad you found us and posted your thoughts/feelings about <ITALIC> She-Ra here! \r\n\r\nI found out about <ITALIC> SPoP because <ITALIC> Tangled fans in <SUBREDDIT> were talking about the show when comparing Cassandra to Catra. So, I finally gave it a chance back in Feb. and boy was I not disappointed! You are exactly right! This series is definitely one of, if not, the best of all time mainly because of its characters (development, relatability, etc.) and reasonable plots.\r\n\r\nGlimmer is my favorite character because we have so much in common. Due to this, I can relate to her much more than any other character. Catra is my second-favorite character because of her development and story arc. In a nutshell, Glimmer and Catra are my two favorite characters because they are complex/complicated, dynamic, and relatable.']",M

So there’s no FNAF World filesystem specific code in the OMC event code. Instead it just calls the new UCN version of writeFlag.\r\n\r\nSince the code hasn’t been shared, I can’t confirm 100% that this is the case, but it is extraordinarily unlikely to be a bug - it would require a huge degree of negligence in writing code, and you would expect to see other, more serious bugs if that was the case (stuff like file saves going missing.) \r\n\r\nHowever, I strongly suspect it’s meant as a fun Easter Egg and not anything deeply lore relevant. At most, it’s an indication that what happens in the main canon can affect FNAF World’s “flipside” - which was already indicated in FNAF World anyways - and if you really stretch it that UCN exists somewhere in the space between the Flipside and the Real World.

This is especially devastating if you Black Rose the field along with Quariongandrax."", ""I appreciate the down to earth and no BS approach he has towards cards. He acknowledges they're good, if they are, but doesn't overhype them. People tend to forget that a single great card doesn't immediately boost its respective archetype, if any, to Tier 0 status. Guardians can get a new card that searches every single Equip and allows you to ignore their restrictions, but I doubt they're gonna be meta relevant with just that.\r\n\r\nOn that note, I'm mixed about how he mostly talks about cards in-archetype. On one hand, I enjoy it because he's talking about the card and how it was meant to be used, and how it interacts with the cards it was designed to support. On the other, sometimes it undersells the card. For the most part, though, I'd say I prefer that he keeps it to those immediately relevant so as not to bloat the video (also because I doubt he wants to bother thinking about every single deck that could theoretically use it).\r\n\r\nSometimes I feel he's unnecessarily nitpick-y, and I don't mean when he shit talks bad cards. I recall him talking about D/D/D Gilgamesh (which was decent to him), saying how it would've been more accurate to read 1 D/D Synchro, Fusion, or Pendulum monster because nobody's gonna summon an Xyz monster due to them not having material this way. While he is correct and did admit he was being so pedantic about it, it kinda felt like a pointless rant since 1) if it doesn't make any functional difference, why bother bloating the text by specifying the three monster types, 2) it's arguably better to have the option to do so anyway even if it won't happen often enough to matter, and 3) it could be future proofing for future Extra Deck monster types that D/D/D may or may not get. Ironically, I might be unnecessarily nitpicking that part of some of his videos.\r\n\r\nOverall, I like him and his content. Quick, concise, and surface-to-mid breakdowns of cards. Some people might prefer in-depth analysis of cards instead of just talking about them in-house, which is fine, but for the most part, I enjoy just surface level reviews of new cards (though I'm not opposed to him making quick shout outs to other archetypes that can make use of it). Usually when I want something deeper, I go to deck breakdowns instead of individual card reviews since it's much easier for me to appreciate and comprehend their impact that way.""]",M

Sometimes people hover and stare, but remember that you are doing this for yourself, not to please others!\r\n\r\n3) Don’t be afraid to work out from home sometimes. Yoga is a great supplement, regardless of what you are doing at the gym (classes, cardio, lifting, etc.) and I cannot recommend it highly enough!\r\n\r\n4) Be sure that you are doing a workout that is comfortable for you, and that makes you happy! And with that, don’t let people bully you into workouts that you aren’t really into. If you enjoy working out alone, and having that time to yourself, do that! If you think you would like working out in a group setting, try a class or CrossFit. My personal feeling is that you have to be comfortable in order to get the most out of it!\r\n\r\n5) Set achievable goals for yourself, and consistently remind yourself why you are doing this. Sometimes working out is rough, and it stinks (literally). But when you start achieving those small goals, and you are reminding yourself why you’re working out, you will feel so much better!\r\n\r\nWorking out is a journey and a process, but it is incredibly rewarding!

By that I mean, if youre fine with body hair or don\'t care about your skin or whatever, it doesn\'t make you any less trans, and vice versa caring about that stuff doesn\'t necessarily make you trans.

They might be the highest.  \r\n\\- Attack faster than both 1h/2h weapons (but do more damage). The difference is certainly more noticeable compared to 2h weapons but they are slightly faster than 1h weapons.  \r\n\\- Require \\*\\*SIGNIFICANTLY\\*\\* less perk investment compared to 1h/2h (3 vs 9) to fully optimize damage. This is because unarmed gets to double-dip in mutations with both Talons and Twisted Muscles.  \r\n\\- Allows the player to take \\*\\*BOTH\\*\\* of the top defense-related cards under strength \\*\\*WITHOUT\\*\\* compromising your damage output. In order to maximize your damage output for 1h/2h, you need to forgo some sort of offensive power (whether it be raw damage, armor penetration, or swing speed). Unarmed does not require any of this.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMy build (for a raw numbers comparison) for the two ""end game"" weapons for Unarmed and 1h (Powerfist + Shishkebab, respectively):  \r\n\\- 41 Str with Adrenal Reaction + Nerd Rage + All 3 Gladiator cards (60%) + Bloody Mess (15%). Both of these weapons are Bloodied.\r\n\r\nShishkebab (with extra flame jets mod) Damage:  \r\n\\- 543 (physical) + 303 (energy) = 846 total damage\r\n\r\nPowerfist (with puncturing mod) \\*\\*without speccing into Iron Fist or having the Talons mutation\\*\\*:  \r\n\\- 1431 (physical) + 0 (energy) = 1431 total damage\r\n\r\n\\*\\*That\'s right. With ZERO perk investment and its major damage booster (Talons) missing from my build, I can do nearly TWICE the damage with a Powerfist\\*\\*\r\n\r\nBy simply investing in the iron fist card:  \r\n\\- 1431 --> 1798 damage. \\*\\*It\'s important to note that while receiving this damage boost, I\'m also able to take Blocker (45% damage reduction in melee combat) and Barbarian (+80 DR). So I do MORE than twice as much damage while also being FAR more survivable.\\*\\*\r\n\r\nHow is this a thing? I normally am a fan of buffing things that are underpowered as opposed to nerfing things that are powerful, but seriously? Even with a 100% buff to the 1h weapons you would be stuck at the \\*\\*SAME\\*\\* level of damage as an Unarmed player but without the two major defensive perks.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, fix the Shishkebab from doing split damage. Make it all physical and actually give it a fire DoT (a la FO3/FNV).\r\n\r\nTLDR; Unarmed is outrageously OP and needs to be nerfed. 1h weapons need to be buffed significantly (literally twice their damage values) in order to be viable.', 'Then you spend 1% of your time doing endgame stuff.

freeslurpeeday97,"[""[PubQ] Query Critique - The Road to Peanut, Literary fiction/satire (55,000 words) \n   Here it is. Genre: literary fiction/satire.   \n\n\nI incorporate some mixed media in the book and I mentioned it briefly at the end. Also, the protagonist doesn't have a name. I chose to do so for my own personal reasons and to represent his identity crisis and how he bases so much of himself off of the past -- it's a choice that as the writer I have decided I cannot part with. Not sure if I need to handle it differently in the query. Thanks!\n\nAfter being arrested for vandalizing the local 7-Eleven as revenge for not receiving free-slurpees, the novel’s nameless, sentimental to a fault protagonist remembers that Peanut would have never been so lackadaisical about security cameras. Peanut, the narrator’s love interest and former best friend, had disappeared two months prior with her ex-boyfriend and his lo-fi indie band who “have done everything that The Beatles had only ever tried to do”. Her disappearance plagues the grief stricken, lovelorn protagonist who is consistently roped into shenanigans with his perpetually drunk Uncle Matt and his thrill-seeking best friend, Trevor. After Trevor convinces the protagonist that Peanut is his twin flame, a toxic spiritual concept that denotes someone is a person’s “other half” in which one person is the “chaser” and the other the “runner”, the trio hijacks an abandoned ice cream truck and travels to a post-industrial wasteland in upstate New York to find her. Along the way, they battle DIY indie music scenes, cannibalistic lumberjacks in dive bars, and estranged motel strangers in a series of humorous, satirical misadventures. Though when they arrive and meet Trevor’s friend Dustin, the three discover that the situation with Peanut’s ex-boyfriend is far more complicated than they had thought. Throughout his adventures, the protagonist learns to let go of lost love and to not chase someone who is running away. The humorous, coming-of-age satire that incorporates mixed media asks if the past has a place in one’s present, if these characters could be any more messed up, and how the hell an ear can be bitten off in a lumberjack bar more than once."", 'Should I drop out of grad school based on a ""gut feeling""? \n I (22F) am in my 1st semester of a teaching (7-12 English) graduate program.

This is my practice for a flash fiction competition I\'m doing in July.\r\n\r\nSetting: Train\r\n\r\nObject: Jade pendant\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I made my way onto the train, I was not to know that my whole life was about to change. Behind me was the mistake I was escaping from and before me was an infinite stretch of possibility. My only reminder of where I came from was my Grandmother’s Jade pendant that hung on a delicate chain around my neck.\r\n\r\nThe train began its journey before I found my seat and my natural clumsiness made it a perilous endeavour. As my seat came into sight, I fell into another traveller accidentally as he distractedly left his seat.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with an insidious grin as he shook off my apology. Feeling a little creeped out I moved on quickly and sank gratefully into my seat. This move had no set destination and as the countryside flew by I contemplated everything that had led me to leaving so suddenly and with only the clothes on my back.\r\n\r\nMy family had disowned me and thrown me out onto the street, my only solace being that I had some savings in my back account from my gap year of work. I could not stand having an accidental meeting with people who had completely frozen me out of their lives, so I fled onto the first train out of the city.\r\n\r\nI was only 20 and not ready to be on my own, but it was better than pretending to not be who I am. Conforming to fit into the strict box’s others had constructed for me was suffocating and breaking free had been freeing, no matter the consequences. I could finally be true.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was ready to keep it a secret until I was ready to move out, but sometimes life has a funny way of forcing things out into the open. Walking into the kitchen on that fateful day everything had been normal until I bumped into a chair and knocked it over. Leaning over to stand it back up, my Grandmother’s pendant fell forward for all to see.\r\n\r\nShaking painful memories away, I reached up to fiddle with the pendant, a habit I had suppressed when hiding it at home. Only, it was not there. I touched my neck and patted my pockets, but it was missing, and I was beginning to panic. Ignoring the sway of the train I stood and made my way back through the car.\r\n\r\nSearching seemed fruitless as I made my whole way through and saw no peeks of green anywhere on the ground or any empty seats. As panic swept me up I had to conclude that someone had picked it up. I made my way through to see if I could find any staff that might have had lost property handed in.\r\n\r\nTrying to find my necklace felt like a huge joke from the universe at the expense of my search to find myself. Because figuring out who I was, was a long process of denial, discovery and panic. I was very much feeling similar feelings of denial and panic, I could only hope that I would soon make a discovery to end my torment.\r\n\r\nNot that discovering who I was had ended any torment, as knowing who I was had not made it easy to accept. Pushing the feelings back to my peripherals where they usually lurked, I moved on, only to bump into the same man I had when I boarded the train. Remembering how he had grinned at me, I had my suspicions that he might know where my necklace gone.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, have you seen a necklace? It has a jade green pendant on it. It was my Grandmother’s.” I asked him, mentally crossing my fingers.\r\n\r\nEmotions flashed across his face, proving to me that he had at least seen it once. I kept the panic from my face and tried to keep my familiar passive mask. The mask I had had to wear everyday since I had realised the truth.\r\n\r\n“I may have seen it. How about we sit together, and you can explain it to me more clearly.\r\n\r\nI was all but certain that he had it by this point and as much as I did not want to sit with him, I believed it was my only chance to see my treasured item again. Without talking I sank into the seat beside him and waited for him to speak. After everything I had endured, conversing with someone slightly creepy was easy.\r\n\r\n“Were you wearing this necklace when you got on the train?” the man asked as he reached forward and touched my neck as though to indicate where my pendant had sat.\r\n\r\nI nodded an affirmative as I leaned back to get away from his clammy hands. This whole situation made me uncomfortable and I fiddled with the hem of my dress to distract myself. My dress that I had bought just that morning after being kicked out.\r\n\r\n“Look, please just let me know if you have seen it. If not, I will see if it has been handed into the staff.” I stood up and prepared to walk away.\r\n\r\nHe grabbed my hand and a weight dropped, almost falling through my fingers. It was my Grandmother’s necklace, my security and the key to who I truly was. I looked up at the man, fury under the surface.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, I was going to give it back. I just wanted to have an excuse to talk to such a pretty girl.”\r\n\r\nMy anger melted away as I contemplated the man in front of me.

Woloa,"[""A 'Seasoned' DND 'Veteran' \n So, my last story notes a man who I called Johnson and stated I had some other stories with him. That was false, some wires were crossed and the bad player I was thinking of with those other stories was a man I'll call Paws for in joke reasons.\r\n\r\nOut of game, Paws is a pretty typical nerd who happens to have the body and voice of a jock, dude's in the navy now and I respect him, we haven't kept in touch lately. In game, he was the worst roleplayer I have ever so much as attempted to play with, and somehow doing more freeform stuff with him one on one later was even worse. There's no long story about Paws, just a handful of little things, since neither of the campaigns he was in made it past session 2. Still fairly light stories because, thankfully, I've only ever been part of one true horror story.\r\n\r\nSo, first was a mostly homebrew thing run with child characters in what amounted to a massive school with no exits that they had to ascend following a nonspecific catostrophic event, this was the first attempt to run this campaign, the second went pretty well until the end and so doesn't really belong here, the third went nowhere.  Session one, the players are Paws and a group legend I'll just refer to as Ben-Sama here, in case he ever comes up again.  Paws plays a bully and Ben-Sama a shy kid, que two hours of fairly realistic bullying and forcing the shy kid to check out potentially dangerous stuff before Paws had to leave. Ben-Sama (the player of Chris Aspen in one of my other stories) took it like a champ because that's what he does. Still, at Ben-Sama's request the campaign was called off.\r\n\r\nLater, I wanted to get some proper DND running, this being before I got my still very good group, hearing this Paws claimed he was a veteran of DND and asked me for some help with a 3.5 character for someone else's campaign while I get mine together. I decided that was fair enough, he wanted to play a dual wielding swordsman and just groaned and nearly fell asleep when I explained to him what the actual rules for dual wielding are in 3.5 and explained to him that the easiest way to get the feats for it is to just play a ranger, but you can't wear anything above light armor while doing it as a ranger because rangers are weird. Ulitmately, I never heard anything about the campaign this ranger we made was for.\r\n\r\nFinal little story, my first time running actual DND, specificly 5th edition. Paws ran a dual wielding ranger because that's his thing, fair enough, Ben-Sama returned with a life cleric and we had a third player who I never met again who ran an assassin rogue. The ranger had suspiciously good stats but sometimes you just roll well, I know that. To his credit, Paws played an antisocial man who never tells anyone anything very well, but then combat came. DND Veteran Paws asked, unironically, what die to roll to attack, and then how to calculate the modifiers. I surmised from this that either the 3.5 game the other ranger was for was played in bizzaro world or he never got to use the character. The rouge was a new player so myself and Ben-Sama (who was also new to DND but had read the rules before playing like a good boy) did our best to teach him while I occasionally clarified spells or other class specific mechanics. The party get their quest and head off to get to work. Session 2, the party realize that, in character, only the ranger knows what they're doing, the ranger refuses to tell them what the mission is for some reason and the others continue to follow him for similarly mysterious reasons. First proper dungeon goes pretty well and if the party had been a bit more attentive to my descriptions of rooms they might have even ambushed the boss. At the end of it, they've killed a wizard who was running a small cult and have to divy up the loot. Paws wants all the magic items, a ring of protection, a magical quarterstaff that requires attunement from a wizard or sorcerer and boots of spider climbing, as well as a handful of unidentified potions. He and Rogue argues about this, appearently, someone had taught Paws that whoever gets the last hit on a dungeon's boss just gets to keep all the magic items. When I refused to side with him he left the campaign and rogue wasn't feeling super into more DND. Paws claimed I was a bad GM because I agreed that loot should be split evenly and sold if you can't use it.\r\n\r\nEdit, Addendum: Appearently I played something with him before those games, even though I don't remember it, looking through old messages it looks like he's the first one to fight a boss I've reworked and reused a couple of times that I call An Ordinary Tapestry. If I ever remember what happened in that old campaign I'll be sure to post any horrific parts of it here."", ""Honestly, man, you're just making it sound like you'd kick someone from your table at the slightest provocation, not exactly a good look.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're deciding who to play pen and paper games with based on their political leaning that's an even worse look."", ""Amen brother.

I wondered to myself, my head hurt like hell, and my surroundings were unfamiliar, <ITALIC> “I must be dreaming… There’s no other reason for this.” I had woken up in what looked like my room… but was inherently different. I’d know if it was my room, and this wasn’t it. All the nerdy decorations were gone, it looked like it had before I moved in. I heard the doorknob jiggled and the door opened, and the girl that entered looked incredibly familiar. She screamed, and ran right back out the door, most likely to get her parents or somebody.\n\n“Oh, just what I needed.” I said to myself and I jumped out the window, because, I reasoned, that if this is in fact a version of my house, there will be a short fall to the bushes directly below. Thank heavens, I was correct, and as I landed, my headphones flew out of my ears. I landed in the bushes, the phone, in an otter case thank god, landed a few feet away. Clambering to get out of the bushes before the girl came outside with somebody; I ran and scooped up the phone. I ran as far away as my feet would carry me, which was downtown. It was all familiar but, again different, as if in a slightly less modern time period. I slowed down and caught my breath, it was at this point I remembered that I had fallen asleep to [a RWBY x SAO mashup]( <LINK>), an odd thing to fall asleep to but, hey I was tired. It was also storming oddly hard that night, cracks of lightning and rolls of thunder kept denying me sleep. When I finally fell asleep, I remember clearly, for some reason, that the words of the song said “This’ll be the day we open up the door.” My thoughts were broken by the girl and at least 2 other people running past the alleyway I was resting in, I only got a quick glimpse of the trio but It looked like the 2 other people were… dressed up as knights?! I poked my head around the corner, and they definitely dressed like knights, they went the whole nine yards too, with metal plating and everything! I could tell because they metallically clanked and clacked.\n\n“You don’t look like you’re from around here…” said a voice from behind me.\n\nI quickly spun around and it was another guy dressed like a knight! I couldn’t see his face but I knew he was eyeing me suspiciously. \n\n“Uh… What, of course I am!” I responded after a moment, hoping I could talk my way out of this situation. \n\n“Uh-huh, sure you are, and what am I supposed to make of your clothes, they’re a composer’s garb, and this isn’t a composer village.” The knight returned coolly.\n\n<ITALIC> “Composers? Did I hear him right? And he said that my everyday clothes were a composer’s garb… Maybe that’s why she freaked out…” \n\n“Did you hear me?” The knight asked, “I told you to explain yourself.”\n\n“Oh, right, yeah, about that…” I stepped backwards towards the other end of the alley, “I’ve got a few errands to run for the, er… Composer college here in town, and they’re really important.” \n\n“Uh-huh, sure they are,” He took a step towards me, closing the distance, “There isn’t an artist college around here for miles, the only ones here in America are in Washington and Rhode Island.”\n\n<ITALIC> “Shit, shit, shit. This is baaad, <ITALIC> not only does this guy think I’m suspicious but I just failed the bluffing check!” \n\nI took another step backwards and instinctively reached for my phone, and whipped it out. The knight took a surprised step backwards but realized it wasn’t something I could hurt him with. For some ungodly reason, I unlocked my phone and the <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> stepped from behind me towards the knight. \n\n<ITALIC> “Alright, what the fuck.” I thought to myself, <ITALIC> “Why the hell is [Star Platinum] here, he’s a stand, not even a character.”\n\nAt this point [Star Platinum] began rushing the knight, while the knight swung wildly at him, and the knight couldn’t keep up with [Star Platinum]’s speed and power and, with one punch, knocked the knight straight out of the alleyway. He tumbled into a trash can. I paused the music on my phone and ran the exact opposite way. I noted that upon pausing the music, [Star Platinum] disappeared much like the way he does in the anime. I kept running. \n\nAfter a while of running, I spotted the girl that looked so damn familiar and once again I ducked behind cover. In sudden realization, there probably was no reason to hide from her; I had just summoned [Star Platinum] with music. It appeared to be magical in this land, and I had no idea what I could do with it. My second thought was to find some clothes more suiting, and to hope I didn’t run into any more knights. \n\n“Hey, Artist guy. Why’re you hiding?” A small voice said to me from below. I jumped a foot into the air, and landed with a soft thud next to the kid.\n\n“Hey, could you show me some of your magic?” The kid questioned me, “Puhhllleeaassee?”\n\n<ITALIC> “The last thing I need is this kid following me around, so I might as well.”\n\n“Okay kiddo, I will but first you got to take me to your house, I can’t hang around here very long.” I replied, and the kid’s face lit up. He grabbed my hand and tugged me along. \nWhen we reached the kids house, he knocked on the door and, who I presumed to be his mother, opened it.\n“Jimmy!” She said with surprise, “Get in here.” \nShe ushered the kid named Jimmy inside, and beckoned for me to follow. I stood awkwardly in their house\'s entrance. Jimmy hurried upstairs and his mom turned to me. \n\n“I don’t even want to know who you are, composer, but you’re welcome here.” She said with a stern but kind voice, “My husband was a composer once, before it was illegal to play music in the streets.”\n\n“Illegal to play music… in the streets? Where am I?” \n\n“Do you mind me divulging a little of the history to you, traveler?” She said with concern, “You seem very confused.”\n\n“Um… yeah, I’m really confused, so please do.” \n\nShe began by telling me her name, it was Angelas. The story went like this…\n“We, humans, inhabited this world; we made use of its resources and eventually found music. Music had properties we could not understand, it created, it destroyed sometimes and even then only a select few could control it to its fullest. A few of these individuals went by names such as Mozaio, Beethaven, Chopping, Hahms.” \n\n<ITALIC> “Funny how these guys all sound like actual composers back home.” I thought to myself.\n\n“These men were geniuses of their craft, they wielded the magic like it was a part of their bodies. Then my husband tried his hand at the craft of magic. Early composers were careful with their magic, creating healing, soothing melodies, nothing destructive whatsoever. However, my husband had different ideas… He used sharp, harsh notes in his music, creating destruction and catastrophe with his musical gift. The King took notice and sent a few great composers to capture my beloved. When they finally did, they asked my husband to fight for the King. He agreed; he and his orchestra went to battle with the neighboring kingdoms… they won all of their battles, and my husband took the power to his head. He rampaged with his orchestra, and laid waste to the land. Eventually his orchestra, led under his mystical playing of the lute, realized their crimes and escaped. A few members tried to kill beloved, but even unarmed, Geolo was too strong for them, his voice ripped their hearts and minds to shreds. And then he ran, and ran and ran. He never came back; there are only stories that pass through from time to time.” She ended the story here and kept with her own narrative, ”He was the strongest that ever lived, and he was my husband, I’m glad that he apparently still lives.”\n\n“And I assume that’s why music is banned from being played?” I asked hesitantly,\n\n“No… Not directly at least, it was his followers that caused the ban of music.” She looked as if she was going to resume the history lesson again. “His followers were crazy, and not nearly as strong as him. Of course they came to me for advice as to his location, and most were disappointed that I didn’t know, and, surprisingly, they were almost peaceable when they left without information. Actually, when I look back on it, I was never harmed by any sort of destructive music… But, anyway, his followers wreaked havoc across the land, even though they were weaker, and were crushed easily by the neigh-invincible Hahms & the rest, but it caused a world-wide musical shutdown. Nothing was allowed to be played, ever, and that brings us to the present day, the only places you can play magic now are Rhode Island and Washington.”\n\nShe inhaled, done with her explanation, turned to the stairs, where Jimmy had probably been listening in the entire time. I chuckled as she scolded him for eavesdropping, and he ran back upstairs. \n\n“So,” I began, “I think I’ll need some new clothes if I’m to blend in here… Do you have anything?”\n\n“Funny you should mention that, I have a plethora of Geolo’s old clothes, I was honestly thinking about giving them to the next composer that I meet or just donating them.”\n\n“And I fit one of those criteria, so I’ll take them, I think.” \n\n“Alright, mind telling me your name, traveler?” \n\nI had to think about this; in this world I could have a new name… I opted to give her a \'fake\' name.\n“My name’s Star, Oliver Star.” \n\n“It’s been my pleasure knowing you, Mr. Star.” She said, and then led me to Geolo’s room, and helped me pack his clothes into a cloth sack, well, all the ones that would fit in the bag. I left my old clothes for her kid, and changed into a pair of normal pants, a simple cloth shirt, and a cloak that reached to my ankles. It was black with a bit of electric blue embellishments, mostly artistic stripes. I thought it suited me, and I then left through the same way I had come in. It was dark and there were a few knights roaming around, they had certain pep to their step which almost looked like a happy sort. I pulled my recently acquired cloak up around my lower face, and flicked the hood up too. \n\nI trekked out of the town, and almost immediately upon reaching a crossroads, I ran into that girl again. Somehow she was dressed in a similar cloak to mine, except the stripes on hers were royal purple and she was sitting on an old log in front of the sign. She appeared to be… crying? I approached her with caution. Her head was bowed down, towards her legs, and she shivered a bit. When I came closer, her head snapped up, her face streaked with tears, and she almost immediately recognized me.\n\n“YOU! What’re you doing here?!” She shouted, “I don’t want to see you!” \n\n“You made me look like a fool, a guy appeared in my bed and then disappeared again!” she continued, “Gone, out of sight, like they never even existed! It was my last strike too, I was always the one who cried wolf and today they kicked me out of the town!”\n\n“All because of you! You bastard!” She finished and hung her head down and cried. \n\nCautiously I restarted my approach, and pulled out my phone, I figured a little soothing could do her good. I browsed my music, looking for something I hoped would be soothing, and choose the cover of <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> which I hadn’t experimented with. \n\nShe took a deep breath, and said, “You’re a composer then?”\n\n“It appears to be what people call my type.”\n\n“Now that I get a good look at you… You’re familiar, but I can’t quite put my finger on it.”\n\n“I feel the same way, it’s odd, you know?” and then it hit me, the way her room looked, the fact that it had been my house, and the odd familiarity of the town. She was this world’s me! I reeled with realization, and toppled backwards onto the ground. \n\n“Why did you fall over?” She asked with genuine concern\n\n“I… you… we’re…” I couldn’t quite put into words the realization I had just made.\n\n“What…?” She obviously hadn’t, or couldn’t put the pieces together, “Are you saying… that maybe we’re perfect for each other?” As I was sitting back up, I fell off the log again when she said that. \n\n<ITALIC> “Perfect for each other!? Well, she is kinda cute, but she’s me! I can’t… Oh, nevermind, it’s more normal than I actually thought.”\n\n“Oh… W-was it something I said?” She actually looked worried, and pulled me back onto the log.\n\n“Nope, It wasn’t anything you said, just something… else.” I said, trying to pull myself together.\n\n“Alright, then… What was it?” She asked\n\nAt that exact moment a knight was walking up the road, she noticed him first and muttered something under her breath. I figured it was a curse of some sort. The knight then took notice of the two off us and he sprinted towards us, drawing his sword. \n\n“Well… I’m not going to be able to out run him…” She dejectedly hung her head, and sat on the log. I, however, opened my phone again, and stood up. \n\n“What’re you doing? You’ll be killed!” I looked back at her, I never got her name... but I decided that I would win this exchange with the knight and learn her name.\n\n“I’m a composer, don’t worry.” \n\nMy phone glowed and lit up my face in the dark, I unplugged my headphones, pulled up a song and hit play. I stuck the phone back into my pocket. The base tones of [Bonetrousle]( <LINK>) filled the air, and were soon accompanied by the flute-like sound of the main melody. A pair of blue bones floated in the air, I grabbed them and flung them at the knight. He cut both of them in half, I summoned a several white bones and shot those at him, he cut these in half as well. He had stopped his advance but began it again, once the bones were cut. \n\n<ITALIC> “If I can’t beat him with Bonetrousle… I’ll try Megalovania!” I paused Bonetrousle and switched to the more threatening Megalovania. The first few notes, wafted out of my phone, shaking the ground slightly, causing him to tremble. Then the baseline kicked in, the ground rumbled even more. And when the melody entered, everything shook. The bones went flying all around the man, the ground trembling. Out of the ground & the air, bones appeared and disappeared, and eventually I hit him with the single blue bone, He was my plaything now. I flung him against waves and waves of bones until his soul shattered and he collapsed into a pile of armor, his body disintegrated along with his soul. I whipped out my phone and paused the song, and everything went quiet. \n\n“Holy…” The girl broke the silence, and I turned around, “He’s dead, the music… its crushed his soul to pieces.” \n\n“I guess so…” I responded, “But he was attacking us, and therefore was self-defense.”\n\n“Yeah… But I’m honestly more interested in how you did that, also, do you think we could take his armor?” She walked up to the pile of armor, and picked up a gauntlet. \n\n“Um… I’ve played D&D before but I don’t think I could actually wear a guy’s armor.”\nShe had already put on armor for her left arm, and she seemed to like it. \n\n“D&D? What’s that?” \n\n“Oh, nothing, don’t worry about it.”\n\n“Alright, you funny man,” She said this as she was trying to put on the sword belt but the sword dragged on the ground, so she abandoned it, “but you really ought to wear the right arm, I’ll even put it on you for you.”\n\n<ITALIC> “Fuck it; I’m probably going to need it at some point anyway.” I thought\n\n“Equip me,” I said, “And if you don’t mind me asking, what’s your name?”\n\nAs she was adjusting the straps on the shoulder plate she said, “My name’s Olivia, Olivia Stellar.”\n<ITALIC> “Jeez, she really is me. She even introduced herself like I did.” I thought as she was putting the arm braces on. “Well, My name’s Star, Oliver Star.” \nAs the last piece of armor, she faltered, “Did you… just say… Oliver Star?”\n\n“Yeah, I did.” The pieces must’ve been falling into place now. \n\n“Wow… We even have similar names! We have got to be destined to be together!” \n\n<ITALIC> “What. Is this chick serious? It might be worth it to teach her how to do magic, which means to sing and whistle. It\'d be useful to have more that one mage in the party.""\n\n“Strange, I guess it <ITALIC> is meant to be!” I replied cheerily, not to stagger this time.\n\nWhen the glove had been put on, we hit the road again, walking down the left road.\n\n<BOLD> —End for now —']",F

(We fostered him after she died.)\r\n\r\nStill, I\'m really nervous about getting my OWN dog. She\'s 2 years old, kind of trained herself like the one we fostered before, and is VERY sweet. I have a very good trainer to help me and I know we can train her properly, but I worry that no matter how well-behaved she is, people will be....idk how to say it...rude? I guess. Because she\'s technically an ""aggressive breed"".\r\n\r\nI\'m also nervous about handling situations like people wanting to pet her or going to a restaurant and people getting upset that she\'s there. I\'m just really anxious. If you have any advice about handling situations or just having a service dog in general, I\'d really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nSorry this is long and kind of rambley. I\'m having a little trouble thinking straight. Anyway, thank you.\r\n\r\n<SUMMARY> Getting my own service dog for the first time. Nervous. Need advice. Thank you.']",M
