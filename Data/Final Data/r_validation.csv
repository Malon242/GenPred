Concretely, the only thing connecting all atheists is a lack of belief in a god. Whether they believe in scientific explanations or not is inconsistent and not pertinent to atheism. But let me explain your points from the most basic view of a lack of belief atheist. \r\n\r\n1. The universe had to come from somewhere.\r\n2. Evolution is <BOLD> extremely improbable.\r\n3. I can't find a good proof against the existence of absolute truths.\r\n4. There are things in the universe that cannot be explained by naturalism/science.\r\n\r\n1. Maybe that‚Äôs true. But so far any explanation regarding a deity making it doesn‚Äôt satisfy me in the way that would convince me. Maybe one did. But I‚Äôm never given a reason or explanation as to how that makes sense, and also never presented with proof of a god existing to do so beforehand. Furthermore, where would a god exist before the universe, in order to create it? I‚Äôm content with waiting for evidence and proof from people who study and investigate these ideas before claiming I know a god did so. \r\n\r\n2. How is it improbable? Furthermore, how is it being improbable matter when it has clearly happened? We‚Äôve had centuries to study evolutionary methods and development, and we are as certain that evolution is actively happening as we are about anything in science. Just because something is improbable doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt happen. Maybe you mean abiogenesis, the process with which life is formed first before evolution. And while we don‚Äôt know how that happened exactly, we know it <ITALIC> did. Whether a god did so remains to be seen or proven, so I won‚Äôt believe anything regarding that topic concretely until something is found out. \r\n\r\n3. That isn‚Äôt how proof works. Proof is for positive claims. Proof is for things that can be proven to be real. If you try and prove a negative there will be holes and excuses until you give up. For example, I‚Äôm a hyper intelligent octopus. You don‚Äôt believe me? Prove me wrong. If you find my account saying otherwise I could claim I was lying. If you find my house I could claim I forwarded the IP address. If you find my ‚Äúbody‚Äù I could claim I‚Äôm an octopus on the outside of the simulated world. Proving a negative is useless, so instead proof lies with the positive claim. It‚Äôs up to <ITALIC> me to prove I‚Äôm an octopus, and up to <ITALIC> you to prove that absolute truths and a god can exist. \r\n\r\n4. What‚Äôs your point? Saying there‚Äôs something science can‚Äôt explain doesn‚Äôt automatically push that onto a god. People thought viruses were once demons, but we learned. They thought lightning was Zeus, but we learned. And we‚Äôll keep learning. Attributing what we don‚Äôt know to a god stagnates our learning by presuming an explanation. I would rather not know and find out than assume to know on a guess or vague belief. Maybe we won‚Äôt explain everything, but we shouldn‚Äôt expect a god to be the answer for all we don‚Äôt know until we know a god can exist and do those things."", 'A word to my gay and bi guys out there: FOREPLAY IS STILL A THING!

I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre attracted to prepubescent characteristics which is disturbing.\n\n‚ÄúFor direct question about defaults in porn and camgirs - most users are males and larger amount of males like it shaven, so the industry tries to appeal to the mass, because mass = money. What I often see in those questions, however, is a message with something along the lines ""it\'s the industry who is in control of the tastes of men and it dictates them to like it shaven, so the industry can profit from sales of cosmetics"". Does such meaning really stand behind those questions sometimes, or am I mistaken?‚Äù Most men watch porn (female exploitation on camera) and most porn actresses are shaven. Do men find it attractive because it‚Äôs normalised in porn, or is it normalised in porn because men find it attractive? If it‚Äôs the former, then I‚Äôm criticising the porn industry for saying women are sexier when they modify their body, and the natural states of their body isn‚Äôt good enough. Women follow these expectations to appeal to men, and so do men because their preferences are being manipulated by what‚Äôs normalised in porn. I criticise that. If it‚Äôs the latter..... why do men find prepubescent characteristics attractive? It cannot be a natural thing, as pubic hair is natural. They‚Äôve been having sex with us for thousands of years when we didn‚Äôt shave, why do they now want a woman completely shaving her pubic hair? Why do they considerer that ‚Äúmore sexy‚Äù? Are they porn sick or do they find adult women less attractive than prepubescent girls? If that is the case, then we have a big problem. \nOfcourse it is not a natural thing, there are men who are more than cool with pubic hair. Most men are porn sick and completely overtaken by porn and the expectations porn puts on women.\n\nSame thing with things like BDSM. It became so normalised since the porn industry became big. The way people have sex has changed, if you compare pre porn era and post.\n\n‚ÄúAs for the question of ""why shaving not normalized for men"" - I think it is, just not as much talked about.‚Äù So.....it‚Äôs not?\n\n\n‚ÄúBut that aside, if we talk stereotypes, I believe it has everything to do with male and female difference and the different qualities that are considered more valuable in each. In men, who are stereotyped to be the warriors/leaders/hard workers/riskers/etc, those qualities are connected to testosterone, and the large amount of body hair is considered a sign of high amounts of it within a man. Therefore body hair becomes ""manly quality"" as a sign of other propable valuable qualities of his character. This is the process as I see it.‚Äù Yeah.. we‚Äôre against these stereotypes here. And even if you use the argument of ‚Äúmen have more body hair naturally and women less‚Äù well yeah... that already is the case. Men on average already have more and women on average already have less, naturally. Why should we shave what we already have less of, naturally, off? \n\n‚ÄúAnd every man is eventually is told to be manly, ""grow some hair on his chest"" and so on.‚Äù Yeah, an old saying based on stereotypes.

You can be a perfectly valid ally to trans rights without having any romantic or even sexual relationship with trans people. I dont find my support for trans rights to be more ""more evolved"" than any other trans ally just because Im in a relationship with a trans woman. So yeah I dont think that was worded correctly. I think Perry is stroking the egos of a lot a men here in hopes that they can be more confident and open with who they are. I think the goal is to say to these men, ""hey perhaps if youre open about yourself and actually TRY to have a meaningful relationship with a trans woman maybe this sexualized fetishization you have of them that you\'ve developed over the years through your closeted secretive obsession will go away.""   \r\n\r\n\r\nNow I can understand and sympathize with the objections being made here. You\'ll always have bad faith actors. You\'ll always have fetishizers posing as allies who will use any buzzword in order to conceal their true intentions that they only want to objectify trans women. Chasers are gonna chase. My point is that your concerns for objectifying chasers would still exist regardless if the word ""transamory"" existed or not.  \r\n\r\n\r\n In a way I also wish that a word like ‚Äútransamory‚Äù didn‚Äôt need to exist, just like I wish the word ""atheist"" didnt exist either. There really shouldnt be a word to describe a non-belief  just like there isnt a word to describe people who dont have a particular hobby. Likewise why should there be a special word to describe a mere relationship between a man and a woman? Trans women are women right? And love is love correct? I wish it were that simple and easy, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt see us there yet. Cis and trans relationships are still scrutinized very much. Thats why many cis people are still quiet about their attractions. That wont change until there are more people open with their attractions and more trans acceptance from the general public.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI understand that being in a relationship with a trans woman means I will not fit the heteronormative role most other cis men like me colloquially ascribe to. I know in most instances my relationship with my girlfriend will not be accepted at face value for what it is so I know I will find myself constantly trying to validate my relationship to others. In this respect I find the word ‚Äútransamorous‚Äù useful in making my cis friends and acquaintances understand my relationship with my girlfriend.   \r\n \r\n\r\nAgain I understand your concerns against the term though. I know you want to be seen as women and not as something ‚Äúother.‚Äù I know you certainly don‚Äôt want to be fetishized. Its obviously a word I would not use to describe myself if Im in a conversation with other trans people. I know trans women are women. I keep the term ‚Äútransamorous‚Äù at arms length sort of speak because of that.

lukeasaur,"['Recipe:\r\n\r\nTurmeric rice: Add about a tablespoon of turmeric, a third of a can of light coconut milk (full fat‚Äôs probably fine, but since it‚Äôs being used as cooking liquid for rice I figured thinner is better), and four rice cups (the little cup of rice that comes with a rice cooker) of white rice to your rice cooker; add water to the fill line, and set the rice cooker to white rice. \r\n\r\nTomato ‚Äútuna‚Äù: This is the star of the show. For full effect, start by peeling the tomatoes: start a pot of boiling water and prepare a bath of cold water. Once it‚Äôs really rolling, cut an X on the bottom of 2-3 plum tomatoes and dunk them in for about 45 seconds to a minute (you don‚Äôt want to cook them). Fish them out and dunk them in the cold water. Peel them from the X. After they‚Äôre peeled, cut them into quarters and scoop out the seeds. Then dice them.\r\n\r\nIf you‚Äôre not up to the whole mess of boiling, I get it! In that case, just dice them. It‚Äôs not as close to a marinated tuna bowl from a sushi bowl restaurant, but it still tastes good, and it makes this recipe 10000x easier. \r\n\r\nEither way, once your tomatoes are diced, put them in a bowl or wide mug (if your roommates used all the bowls and didn‚Äôt wash them), then add around a tablespoon each of sesame oil and olive oil, and a good pinch of salt. The salt isn‚Äôt just for flavor - it helps the tomatoes express extra juice - so don‚Äôt skip it and expect the same results! Refrigerate for at least half an hour, but it‚Äôll last longer than that if you want to prep it in the morning and eat it when you get home. Drain off the excess oil and juice (in my experience, more than half the oil drains off, so the 2 tablespoons isn‚Äôt as much as it looks like, but you need enough that it gets into all the tomatoes). \r\n\r\nSpicy mayo: You can buy this in the store, or make it yourself by mixing about 5 parts mayo, 1 part sriracha. A few drops of sesame oil can add a nice flavor. Vegan mayo will work fine! Avocado mayo will work fine! Low fat mayo will work fine! Don‚Äôt stress it!\r\n\r\nOnce you‚Äôve assembled these three ingredients, you‚Äôll want to take a bowl and add some warm rice, between 2/3 and 1 1/4 cups depending on how much you like rice (you don‚Äôt want it hot - if you‚Äôre microwaving pre-prepared or leftover rice, try ~30 seconds). Add the tomato, then add 1/2 of a small avocado, sliced thinly. After that‚Äôs done, top with the spicy mayo and some soy sauce. \r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs not a perfect recreation of the marinated tuna sushi bowls I used to eat - but it‚Äôs closer than I thought I‚Äôd get!

The problem there is that it requires 4 non-searchable cards. I'm hoping they release Scrapyard somewhere down the line to make set Goblin+Factory more consistent, but I highly doubt it since pretty much every Scrap card save for Wyvern is already in the game.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, the most consistent game plan is to tough it out and win the resource game, hoping you at least break even as the turns go by.

If you are really afraid they will cut off funding, put off telling them you\'re not going on a mission for as long as you can using that method. \n\nLastly, I would consider sitting your parents down and telling them that you\'ve been thinking about how you only have a few last years to be with them at home before leaving to embark on life independently and that your goal is to create happy memories with them that you will all look back on for the rest of your lives. Tell them you want to be a ""good"" person and you don\'t want this time to be filled with fighting.

Paws plays a bully and Ben-Sama a shy kid, que two hours of fairly realistic bullying and forcing the shy kid to check out potentially dangerous stuff before Paws had to leave. Ben-Sama (the player of Chris Aspen in one of my other stories) took it like a champ because that's what he does. Still, at Ben-Sama's request the campaign was called off.\r\n\r\nLater, I wanted to get some proper DND running, this being before I got my still very good group, hearing this Paws claimed he was a veteran of DND and asked me for some help with a 3.5 character for someone else's campaign while I get mine together. I decided that was fair enough, he wanted to play a dual wielding swordsman and just groaned and nearly fell asleep when I explained to him what the actual rules for dual wielding are in 3.5 and explained to him that the easiest way to get the feats for it is to just play a ranger, but you can't wear anything above light armor while doing it as a ranger because rangers are weird. Ulitmately, I never heard anything about the campaign this ranger we made was for.\r\n\r\nFinal little story, my first time running actual DND, specificly 5th edition. Paws ran a dual wielding ranger because that's his thing, fair enough, Ben-Sama returned with a life cleric and we had a third player who I never met again who ran an assassin rogue. The ranger had suspiciously good stats but sometimes you just roll well, I know that. To his credit, Paws played an antisocial man who never tells anyone anything very well, but then combat came. DND Veteran Paws asked, unironically, what die to roll to attack, and then how to calculate the modifiers. I surmised from this that either the 3.5 game the other ranger was for was played in bizzaro world or he never got to use the character. The rouge was a new player so myself and Ben-Sama (who was also new to DND but had read the rules before playing like a good boy) did our best to teach him while I occasionally clarified spells or other class specific mechanics. The party get their quest and head off to get to work. Session 2, the party realize that, in character, only the ranger knows what they're doing, the ranger refuses to tell them what the mission is for some reason and the others continue to follow him for similarly mysterious reasons. First proper dungeon goes pretty well and if the party had been a bit more attentive to my descriptions of rooms they might have even ambushed the boss. At the end of it, they've killed a wizard who was running a small cult and have to divy up the loot. Paws wants all the magic items, a ring of protection, a magical quarterstaff that requires attunement from a wizard or sorcerer and boots of spider climbing, as well as a handful of unidentified potions. He and Rogue argues about this, appearently, someone had taught Paws that whoever gets the last hit on a dungeon's boss just gets to keep all the magic items. When I refused to side with him he left the campaign and rogue wasn't feeling super into more DND. Paws claimed I was a bad GM because I agreed that loot should be split evenly and sold if you can't use it.\r\n\r\nEdit, Addendum: Appearently I played something with him before those games, even though I don't remember it, looking through old messages it looks like he's the first one to fight a boss I've reworked and reused a couple of times that I call An Ordinary Tapestry.

For anyone who doesn\'t know it, the Brother of Jared was instructed, after the Tower of Babel, to build ‚Äúbarges‚Äù or boats to carry their people across the ‚Äúmany waters‚Äù to the Promised Land.  The Brother of Jared didn\'t want his people to be sitting in the dark in these barges, so he gathered stones and asked the Lord to touch each stone so they would shine and could be used like little lamps.  The Lord touched each stone with his finger and they then miraculously glowed.\n\nMy Primary teacher shared with us that the Brother of Jared was referred to that way because his real name was very long and awkward.  His name was actually ‚ÄúMohonrimoriancumr.‚Äù  My childhood mind immediately perked up, and I remember thinking about all the families I knew.  Some families tended to name their kids unusual names and others would go with more traditional ones, but I didn\'t know any family who named some of their kids something traditional, like ‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù and others something unusual, like ‚ÄúOsvaldo.‚Äù\n\nI remember trying to imagine two real parents who would actually name one of their sons ‚ÄúJared‚Äù and the other son ‚ÄúMohonrimoriancumr.‚Äù   It sounded ridiculous to me.  It would be like if a new family moved into the ward and the mom said:  I want you to meet our two daughters.  Their names are ""Jenny"" and ""Hiwahiwakeiki,"" but you can just call them ""Jenny"" and the ""Sister of Jenny,"" to make it easier.  I remember actually covering my mouth while I looked up at the ceiling with my eyes widened and thinking to myself, ‚ÄúOoooookay.‚Äù\n\nThis is just one weird little shelf item among dozens of shelf items from my childhood, but it underscores the fact that the Mormon religion is so quirky!\n\nThe story of how the Brother of Jared\'s name was ‚Äúrevealed‚Äù is the perfect example of how Joseph Smith seems like such a narcissist who always had to have the dramatic moment. For anyone interested, this origin story was found in Wikipedia under ""Brother of Jared"":\n\n‚ÄúSome years after the publication of the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith was residing in Kirtland, Ohi<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>, when Reynolds Cahoon had a son. One day, when Smith was passing his door, Cahoon called him in and asked Smith to bless and name the baby. Smith did so and gave the boy the name of Mahonri Moriancumer. When Smith finished the blessing, he laid the child on the bed and told Cahoon that the \'name I have given your son is the name of the brother of Jared; the Lord has just shown \\[or revealed\\] it to me.\' Cahoon heard Smith make that statement to his father, and that was the first time the name of the brother of Jared was known in the church (George Reynolds, ""The Jaredites,"" <ITALIC> Juvenile Instructor, 1 May 1892, 282).‚Äù\n\nMy take on the moral to that story is don\'t let anyone name your baby but yourself, especially not a crazy person who claims they are a prophet!\n\nTLDR: As a young child in Primary I didn\'t think it was believable at all that any parents would ever name one of their sons ‚ÄúJared‚Äù and the other one ‚ÄúMohonrimoriancumr.‚Äù', ""It all seems so clear now that it's hard to understand how some still can't see it."", 'Congratulations on your success!

Ownard,"[""I [20M] feel like one of my closest friends [19F] uses me when things are getting rough with her boyfriend \n Hey guys,\r\n\r\nThis one is a toughie for me to put into words so I am just gonna paint the whole picture. \r\n\r\nI was having a couple beers in the garden and I was reflecting on my friends and how grateful I am to have such wonderful people in my life. My best buddy, I've know him since I was 3, we've been through thick and thin together. My boys, they've always had my back and were willing to travel 3 hours when the dude my ex cheated on me with started getting cocky and threatening me. Then I got to this girl, let's call her Jane (not a real name obviously). \r\n\r\nI've only known the girl a couple years but we've both became great friends over those years. Despite us first tip-toeing the line between friends and more for the first couple weeks, when I found out she had a boyfriend, I backed off immediately and decided that I liked this girl enough to build a close friendship with - but nothing more. She is a fantastic girl who has supported me through my PTSD after my RTA. This girl got out of bed, came to.my room in student halls and held me after I woke from my worst night terrors. I couldn't have asked for a better friend during those times.\r\n\r\nThis is a quick interlude, but early on, I gathered Janes boyfriend was a collosal jerk. I can't even remember how many times I've had that girl crying in my arms over this guy whether him ignoring her, being mean, hell the boy even cheated on her. Yet she still forgave him and continued the relationship. I personally think that he knows he can get away with it because he knows her insecurities, so does it.\r\n\r\nOne behaviour I have noticed, is that when Janes relationship gets tested, normally by his behaviour but sometimes by hers aswell - she will become a lot closer to me. For example, every so often, like once every two or three weeks, we will have a movie night and a catch up because we are generally very busy people. I've noticed that when their relationship is doing okay, we do our usual greeting hug but she will sit at the other end of the bed (student halls, I have a room with a bed and that's it). However, when their relationship is on the rocks, I've noticed she gets really snuggly into me like, borderline spooning. \r\n\r\nJust to clarify, this is not an odd thing for me. I am a very physical person and this is how I show affection. I often snuggle with my single female friends when we have the same catch ups because I am a giant teddy bear.\r\n\r\nThe conversation is different too. If they are doing good, then it is a normal catch up: what we've done, who we've seen, ask about others, you know the drill. But if it's hit bad times, she always steers the conversation towards sex.\r\n\r\nLike I say, I have only just noticed this pattern occuring and I am not sure what to make of it. At first glance, it looks like she is using me for validation when her boyfriend isn't giving it but I get the feeling that there may be more than meets the eye. I am the first person she goes to when something goes wrong, usually because I will just give her tea, a hug and listen - because I've gathered there is no point giving advice because she will do the opposite anyway.\r\n\r\nAnyway, so what do you fine folk think of my predicament? Any advice and opinions are appreciated!\r\n\r\nTL:DR - Friend gets really snuggly and talks about sex when her relationship is on the rocks but keeps a healthy distance and normal conversation when it's going good. Think I may be being used for validation but I get the feeling there may be more to it."", 'You throw out a lot of options here, so if you were to bet, which one would you put your money on?', 'Best spellcaster for a Nuke lobbing mage? \n Hey there, Looking for a spellcaster that is capable of nuking opponents with great efficiency.

I would then attack and throw my low mana spells at them and it didn't didn't matter.  Even playing with debuffs didn't matter.  Why?  Every other turn they get to heal for 300 points.\n\nFinally, I just couldn't win against a single person.  Seemed like every time I dropped in was wasted because their wisp just healed, and healed, and healed.  The most annoying battles were the ones where the opponent only had buffs and debuffs so I would find myself just spam attacking for over 20 minutes having every bit of damage undone by the Wisp, and then I would flee out of boredom cause they either couldn't damage me or had no real attacks at all.\n\nI finally just avoided the arena because it was a total waste.  Ended up with 39 arena tokens and decided I would put this to the test.\n\nI spent 30 arena tokens.  \n\nOut of 30 rounds, only THREE opponents did not have a Wisp.\n\nOut of the 27 with a Wisp, 12 killed me after I ran out of mana.\n\nAgainst the 15 that wouldn't/couldn't kill me, I had to flee due to the stale mate loop of them doing no damage and my attacks being healed over and over.\n\nSo in conclusion, <BOLD> CAN WE REMOVE FOLLOWERS FROM THE ARENA?""]",F

You may not need to go as small as a gaiwan, but I would consider using a brewing vessel that isn't larger than 300ml.  When I first got into brewing with shorter infusions and more leaf to water ratio, I basically measured out my water in a measuring cup, fill the kettle I was going to use, and watched where the water line was when refilling. That way, even with a larger brewing vessel I could still brew in 75ml/100ml steeps despite only owning a 500ml teapot. \r\n\r\nThat being said, there's nothing wrong with brewing larger amounts. You may find that you need to adjust your leaf amount if you want but you go there flavor but the same is true for any other way you brew tea.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have found that I like Eastern style brewing (less water, more leaf, less time per each steep, multiple infusions) because I don't get hit with the dry tannins quite as strongly as I do if I'm brewing western style (more water, less leaf, more time).\r\n\r\nFor the sincha, I think what they mean by contact with air is leaving the bag open or in a non airtight container after you open it. Once you started stepping it contact with air shouldn't be a huge issue, so I wouldn't recommend brewing it and then leaving it out for a long time before returning to it.\r\n\r\nAs to puer recommendations, I have found that the small rose puer tuocha have a sweet flavor. My personal favorite is Crimson Lotus Tea's 2000 Old Warrior. I don't think there's really a puer that doesn't have that barn-like flavor but I definitely think that there are good ones and there are bad ones.\r\n\r\nLastly,  if you're looking for a really nice naturally sweet tea, I recommend steering towards oolongs.  They can have a ton of flavor, and you're more likely to get the type of flavor you're looking for in a tea it seems like? My current personal favorite I got from <USER> and it's bitter gourd stuffed with roasted tie guan yin oolong. It's roasty, nutty, and absolutely incredible!""]",NB

idkwhattoputhere000,"['Did you go cold turkey with makeup and shaving, what was your journey with it like? \n Personally, since discovering radical feminism, I‚Äôve become more critical as to why I want to wear makeup, why do I feel better with it, why do I feel like I have to shave?\n\nI realised that it does come from a place of seeking validation from society and both the male as the female gender, and that putting my value on how attractive I look and adhering to modern day expectations of femininity is not something I do for myself. I do it for societal validation. For myself I wear 0 makeup and don‚Äôt shave my legs. Why would I bother, if it is for myself? For myself I choose comfort. The beauty industry is inherently anti feminist as it tells us our natural faces and body hair aren‚Äôt as ‚Äúgood‚Äù as altered.\n\nSo I started asking myself why do I feel better when I change the way I naturally look, it‚Äôs not like any of those things are unhealthy. It cannot be a natural drive to use lots of makeup or shave everything off. My natural face is natural. My body hair is natural. Which means it 100% is socialisation to feel the need to change it. The expectations of femininity lookwise have changed so many times throughout society, altering our body hair and wearing makeup don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúnature‚Äù reason. Nature already gave us the ‚Äútools‚Äù , the way it is supposed to be. As long as you‚Äôre healthy, you‚Äôre fine.\n\nPersonally I stopped shaving my pubic hair as even before discovering radical feminism I found it way more... it sounds corny but empowering? I feel better with a bush. I shave next to my labia because that feels better to me but I let most of it grow. I‚Äôm wearing less makeup than I used to, like 10% of the time as opposed to 60% or so. I only wear a full face of makeup when I see the guy that I like (while he literally gives 0 fucks about it) , or when I go out. I feel good with it being like that, because I‚Äôm doing it consciously now and asking myself questions as to why I do it. I like wearing makeup, and I like not wearing makeup. I‚Äôm just as comfortable with both now. I used to be ashamed of leg hair, now I don‚Äôt have any problems with wearing a dress or skirt while having my legs non shaven and going to a park or so.\n\nI do still shave my legs for other occasions, maybe it is social conditioning, but still feel less like I HAVE to do it. I‚Äôm not as ‚Äúashamed‚Äù of visible leg hair anymore. Now I do it when I want it, and because I prefer it that way. But I‚Äôm not ashamed to sometimes go outside with visible unshaved legs anymore. I shave my armpits because I find that more comfortable personally when I wear something long sleeve but I‚Äôm just happy to be critical of it and ask myself ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù .

This is my practice for a flash fiction competition I\'m doing in July.\r\n\r\nSetting: Train\r\n\r\nObject: Jade pendant\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I made my way onto the train, I was not to know that my whole life was about to change. Behind me was the mistake I was escaping from and before me was an infinite stretch of possibility. My only reminder of where I came from was my Grandmother‚Äôs Jade pendant that hung on a delicate chain around my neck.\r\n\r\nThe train began its journey before I found my seat and my natural clumsiness made it a perilous endeavour. As my seat came into sight, I fell into another traveller accidentally as he distractedly left his seat.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with an insidious grin as he shook off my apology. Feeling a little creeped out I moved on quickly and sank gratefully into my seat. This move had no set destination and as the countryside flew by I contemplated everything that had led me to leaving so suddenly and with only the clothes on my back.\r\n\r\nMy family had disowned me and thrown me out onto the street, my only solace being that I had some savings in my back account from my gap year of work. I could not stand having an accidental meeting with people who had completely frozen me out of their lives, so I fled onto the first train out of the city.\r\n\r\nI was only 20 and not ready to be on my own, but it was better than pretending to not be who I am. Conforming to fit into the strict box‚Äôs others had constructed for me was suffocating and breaking free had been freeing, no matter the consequences. I could finally be true.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was ready to keep it a secret until I was ready to move out, but sometimes life has a funny way of forcing things out into the open. Walking into the kitchen on that fateful day everything had been normal until I bumped into a chair and knocked it over. Leaning over to stand it back up, my Grandmother‚Äôs pendant fell forward for all to see.\r\n\r\nShaking painful memories away, I reached up to fiddle with the pendant, a habit I had suppressed when hiding it at home. Only, it was not there. I touched my neck and patted my pockets, but it was missing, and I was beginning to panic. Ignoring the sway of the train I stood and made my way back through the car.\r\n\r\nSearching seemed fruitless as I made my whole way through and saw no peeks of green anywhere on the ground or any empty seats. As panic swept me up I had to conclude that someone had picked it up. I made my way through to see if I could find any staff that might have had lost property handed in.\r\n\r\nTrying to find my necklace felt like a huge joke from the universe at the expense of my search to find myself. Because figuring out who I was, was a long process of denial, discovery and panic. I was very much feeling similar feelings of denial and panic, I could only hope that I would soon make a discovery to end my torment.\r\n\r\nNot that discovering who I was had ended any torment, as knowing who I was had not made it easy to accept. Pushing the feelings back to my peripherals where they usually lurked, I moved on, only to bump into the same man I had when I boarded the train. Remembering how he had grinned at me, I had my suspicions that he might know where my necklace gone.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúExcuse me, have you seen a necklace? It has a jade green pendant on it. It was my Grandmother‚Äôs.‚Äù I asked him, mentally crossing my fingers.\r\n\r\nEmotions flashed across his face, proving to me that he had at least seen it once. I kept the panic from my face and tried to keep my familiar passive mask. The mask I had had to wear everyday since I had realised the truth.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI may have seen it. How about we sit together, and you can explain it to me more clearly.\r\n\r\nI was all but certain that he had it by this point and as much as I did not want to sit with him, I believed it was my only chance to see my treasured item again. Without talking I sank into the seat beside him and waited for him to speak. After everything I had endured, conversing with someone slightly creepy was easy.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúWere you wearing this necklace when you got on the train?‚Äù the man asked as he reached forward and touched my neck as though to indicate where my pendant had sat.\r\n\r\nI nodded an affirmative as I leaned back to get away from his clammy hands. This whole situation made me uncomfortable and I fiddled with the hem of my dress to distract myself. My dress that I had bought just that morning after being kicked out.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúLook, please just let me know if you have seen it. If not, I will see if it has been handed into the staff.‚Äù I stood up and prepared to walk away.\r\n\r\nHe grabbed my hand and a weight dropped, almost falling through my fingers. It was my Grandmother‚Äôs necklace, my security and the key to who I truly was. I looked up at the man, fury under the surface.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I was going to give it back.

That only proves my point. \r\n\r\n...I will never fault you for getting the hell out, moving to Texas from our home state, Missouri, to get away from the screaming and the emotional abuse, and get away from... sadly, what a bastard my ""brother"" had truly been, and a bastard your step-dad/my biological father is.\r\n\r\nYou never ""left me"". You just did the smart thing and got out. I was 11 years old. That\'s when I was alone in the house. As afraid as I was the first couple of years, developed unhealthy coping mechanisms in the mean time, I grew to love the peace and quiet, and disliked it when dad was off work.\r\n\r\n...Even when I was scared, you answered the phone, 1,000 miles away, and talked to me, calmed me down, as long as you could before you had to go to bed for work, had to leave to do something with your now-husband, whatever it was. \r\n\r\nEven 1,000 miles away..., you had not abandoned your mother-like duties to your baby sister that you\'d raised. You took me to theme parks, Disney on Ice, Laser Tag, Bowling. You disciplined me when I deserved it. You apologized when you were wrong‚Äîsomething mom and dad never did. We did things like a family would‚Äîyou, N, and I.\r\n\r\nYou tried to ""police me"" in terms to style and shit, like mom did. Again, trying to be a mom, even when it pissed me off. I never listened, just like I never listened to mom. ""Pick your battles,"" as you both said.\r\n\r\nNow adults, we hang out, go to lunch, lounge around your house, do ""adult-y"" things. You have two kids. O is three, K a year on the 8th of July. \r\n\r\nAnd yet..., I can still come to you for help, for advice, where I know mom would blow up, or get smug with ""I-Told-You-So\'s"", knowing you\'ll be there to lend and ear and give honest feedback. \r\n\r\n...Sisi, I\'ll never call you by your first name; it\'s just weird. Maybe it\'s fitting though. It\'s a theme. You never call your mother by their first name. I couldn\'t say your first name as a toddler, but... I think it stuck for a reason.\r\n\r\nI\'m sorry for being a little shit growing up. I\'m sorry for saying such terrible things as a teenager, being so cold, not coming around when I should have, disappearing from family events when we\'d moved down here when I was 16. The mental disorders are no excuse for that. I hope you\'ve truly forgiven me.\r\n\r\nYou\'ve always been a protector, loved me unconditionally..., been ""mom"" where our\'s has failed. She\'s not perfect, put up with a lot, taken a lot from dad, but you shielded me from what you could when you could, from the both of them. \r\n\r\nPlease forgive me for how I\'ve treated you in the past. I hope to god you can focus on our relationship now, at 22 and 32, as it\'s much better than it\'s been. \r\n\r\n~Jessie', ""Breda, Noord-Brabant.

Kool-Kukumber,"['Daily Song Discussion - Beetlebum (S/T) \n I‚Äôm starting the song discussions back up, and the song we‚Äôre looking at first was perhaps the most important song Blur had put out to that point, the opening track and lead single of the self titled album, Beetlebum. This song marked the first sign of a drastic change in Blur‚Äôs music, and taking a look at the lyrics you can definitely see the evolution occurring. For one of the first times in Blur‚Äôs discography Damon directly calls upon his own experiences when constructing lyrics, as the song describes his heroin addiction and drug experiences with Justine Frischmann. \r\n\r\nMusically the song is as dark as the lyrics, and act as a stark contrast to the bright and sunny sound we‚Äôve heard on Blur‚Äôs previous albums. One thing that hasn‚Äôt changed however is Graham‚Äôs guitar wizardry; his eclectic playing once again anchors the song, and his Beatle-esque backing vocals work fantastically alongside Damon‚Äôs. \r\n\r\nReleased as a single on January 20, 1997, the song defied fears from Blur‚Äôs record label that it would dent Blur‚Äôs popularity, as the song became their second number 1 single on the UK Singles Chart.\r\n\r\nLyrical highlight: ‚ÄúI just slip away and I am gone‚Äù\r\n\r\nMusical highlight: Guitar playing\r\n\r\nBest performer: Damon, Graham\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>', 'Yeah it‚Äôs a real shame. According to the video‚Äôs comments the only reason Alex even played it here was because Andy was having technical difficulties with his bass, and Alex just decided to fill the time by performing a song they hadn‚Äôt released yet.', ""Daily Song Discussion - Song 2 (S/T) \n Well this next song doesn‚Äôt require much introduction; Song 2 is the infamous second track and second single on the self titled album, and perhaps exists as one of the most misunderstood and ironic songs to reach high levels of popularity. Intended as a parody of grunge, the lyrics of the song make no sense, and are a intentional dig at grunge bands such as Nirvana who would use strange and unrelated phrases to construct their lyrics. In this way the lyrics came off as hilarious, and yet they work surprisingly well with the music, especially that classic ‚ÄúWoo-hoo!‚Äù refrain.\r\n\r\nMusically the song is unlike anything Blur have done so far. Alex‚Äôs bass guitar is distorted to a large degree and Graham‚Äôs meticulous guitar work is thrown out the window in favour of a much simpler, yet very pulsating approach. Dave‚Äôs drum work here also gives the song its heavy nature, and his drum introduction is one of the most iconic parts of the song.\r\n\r\nFittingly, the song reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, and was a surprise hit in the United States, reaching number 6 on the US Alternative Songs chart. It remains easily Blur‚Äôs biggest hit in the US and much of the world, despite not accurately representing much of the band‚Äôs sound.\r\n\r\nLyrical highlight: ‚ÄúI got my head checked, By a jumbo jet, It wasn't easy, But nothing is, no‚Äù\r\n\r\nMusical highlight: Guitar work, bass work, drum work\r\n\r\nBest performers: Damon, Graham, Alex and Dave\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>"", 'If I may ask how were you able to see inside Studio 2?

The question was: ""Why do you feel like your religion is right?""\n\nAs a former evangelical protestant who converted to being a Catholic over a ton of issues, there\'s a lot of things that make me very pleased with my choice. The fact that there is a massive amount of writing and history behind the vast majority of church ideas (No, ""because, that\'s why"" which I got all the time as a protestant) and many ""rites"" or varieties of worship, all with the same essential center point in Christ.\n\nThe fact that questions and dialogue were welcomed even on divisive matters, far more than I thought they would be, and that the average priest I encountered had acceptable and even profound answers, not to mention other devoted Catholics. There was an abundance of studied belief among devout practicing Catholics, not just blind acceptance.\n\nI was pleased by the time and financial commitment to the social good so many Catholics have - a ton of devoted Catholics are in service and helping professions. The majority of us love science, rhetoric, and logic and use it in discussion, which often surprises people without a faith system who haven\'t met someone in a religious system that welcomes these things, though it\'s not as uncommon even in other religious systems as people with no religious background may have experienced. Devout Catholics take after Jewish people in their interest in discussions without easy answers.\n\nThe encouragement to care for the earth and each other and even ourselves with self-worth, and the acknowledgement that we are not naturally good.\n\nHonestly, the list is pretty long.\n\nAll of these things suited me, but above all, I do believe in the God of the Bible, and that the Bible is an anthology of works that pertain to his acts and presence in the world, and the records of people in history that can help us today - and that there are thousands more saints throughout history whose record is added to that. If it were just the Bible, that would be one thing. But the record of many who like I do today, worshipped and strived to become the human they were created to be... That\'s inspiring. The Catholicism I chose makes me strive to be better, kinder, more aware of the needs and desires of others - not just Jesus. \n\nI had Jesus before Catholicism. He made me want to be better, but I didn\'t feel like I had a great path. Catholicism gave me the path to walk on.

Achemar,"['""Who talks?"" A commentary on Roblox chat systems \n In Roblox, one of the key features of the platform lies in it\'s chat system. It gives players the capability to communicate and discuss with each other in-game. This chat system, however, was not always as available as it is now. \r\n\r\nIn 2014, Roblox begin to experiment with letting all players chat. I remember being younger, and all of a sudden having a strange box full of a ton of messages from strangers appear in my top left corner. I had never even known this was a feature. All I knew, was Super Safe Chat.\r\n\r\nThe new chat, available to all players, was now dubbed Safe Chat (when regarding the new, younger players able to communicate). In those days, the filter was restrictive, but still lenient enough to warrant conversation. It was still new, and had much time to be improved on. \r\n\r\nRoblox was still small, having a third of active users now present today. When I found a server of people, I\'d almost always type ""Who talks?"". It was the pseudo-replacement of ""Wanna be friends?"" as it immediately introduced you to the other players, and defined you as another one of them.\r\n\r\nOver time, however, the use of ""Who talks?"" gradually declined, as people got increasingly familiar with the new chat system and you could see this as soon as you joined. This trend lasted for many years. However, it was soon to go south.\r\n\r\nRoblox chat is a feature, it expands upon gameplay, and provides another input, this time, to the other players. When a feature goes unused or costs more than it gives, it is removed. This can be seen with the Forums, Tix, and others. I want you to go into a random game on the front page, and see how active the chat is. \r\n\r\nI recently tested this out, and went into Lifting Simulator 3. Not much to my surprise, the only chat was one person repeatedly spamming ""NO KILL"" over and over. By the time I had joined, however, this player had left and no new chats were being made. I say for 5 minutes, and only one message had been said.\r\n\r\nI also went into Adopt Me for 3 minutes, and the only people chatting were two Russian people, back and forth, in Russian. The server had some odd 35 people in it.\r\n\r\nThe places where you see chat used frequently tend to be poor roleplaying games, or niche games with strong communities. But many of these don\'t bring in as much money as other games (think Lifting Simulator or Jailbreak). \r\n\r\nIf this trend continues, we may see Roblox start to put chat in the hands of the developers, instead of providing it automatically. While unlikely this is something we must consider, because, today, when I ask ""Who talks?"", I get no answer.', 'Excuse me what? Please list, I have seen a lot of videos of the game and it seems absolutely lovely.', ""It's just a custom skybox. He managed to balance lighting out right and put the sun in a nice position.

A local Food City supermarket was designated Sector Alpha-Niner, the Jiffy Lube was Bravo-Lima-Fiver, the local $1 store was Golf-16 and finally, the most coveted assignment, the local mall being Zebra-1.\r\n\r\nBack then, before my corporate sponsorship, my gear was severely limited due to out of pocket expenses. I was armed with a Glock 17 <BOLD> (one of the first, given to me by Gaston Glock personally in honor of my former black-ops experiences) and a Remington 870P 14‚Ä≥ bbl holder loaded with 000 magnums. On this particular fateful day my team was assigned to patrol Sector Zebra-1, the mall.\r\n\r\nIt was an uneventful Saturday, until the unthinkable happened‚Ä¶\r\n\r\nIt was about 8:45PM, and the mall was closing and nearly empty. Me and my ‚Äôshadow‚Äô were sweeping quadrant 069E, the mall arcade, a known hot-spot for Asian gangs and their assorted thugs. The arcade was located at the far east end of the mall, next to the movie theater and the Orange Julius. I smelled trouble, and couldn‚Äôt spot any movement from the arcade, which was unusual due to the presence of a new Mortal Kombat arcade game. <BOLD> Those Asians love Mortal Kombat. \r\n\r\nI went to ‚Äúcondition red‚Äù and discreetly unholstered my Glock 17 loaded with Black Talons. I motioned to my partner to sweep right to flank the arcade, but he was already in motion sensing the trouble in my facial expression. My partner drew his S&W 1006 and went prone behind a potted palm tree. \r\n\r\nWe crept towards the arcade, when the power suddenly cut out. It was an ambush! \r\n\r\nI could still see relatively well due to the full moon, shining through the building‚Äôs skylights, and years in a dark secret Albanian prison had honed my natural night vision to that of a tomcat. <BOLD> A gangster popped up from behind the Orange Julius counter with a full auto Kalashnikov equipped with a 75 round drum, and opened up in the direction of my partner, meanwhile two other perps popped up from behind the skee-ball machine armed with sawed down 12 gauges. Another two perps appeared on the upper level and brought down hell-fire on us from above. One had a Winchester Model 70 in .30-06 with a 10x scope and the other was laying down suppressing fire with a Mac-10 variant. The perps were all sporting cheap Russian night vision goggles.\r\n\r\nI dove under a metal bench, and lined my Glock's sights on the AK bandit. A double-tap to the chest, and a quick follow-up to the head brought him down like a sack of potatoes. My partner had been hit in the leg by some buckshot but he kept fighting like a champ, he took out one of the shotgunners with a well aimed 10mm HP to the temple, while I started unloading into the glass partition that surrounded the upper level. \r\n\r\nWhen the sniper ran for cover I drew a bead on him, adjusted for distance, and dropped two into his abdomen. The Mac-man ran for it, at the sight of the bloody guts pouring out his partner‚Äôs stomach. I did a quick tactical reload, dropping the used magazine on the floor, then quickly grabbed the 870P from the harness on my back, and did some tactical combat rolls over to the movie theater, backflipping over the concession counter while simultaneously unloading the 5 rounds of 000 into the skee-ball machine. \r\n\r\nMy partner was pinned down, I dumped my empty 870, and realized I couldn‚Äôt hit the remaining perp due to my the poor angle of attack. I had to act fast or my partner was done for. \r\n\r\nI leap over the counter again, and low crawled towards the arcade unseen. I crept behind the Ms. Pac-Man arcade cabinet, and when I heard the perp reloading, jumped up with my trusty K-Bar, and threw it into the perp‚Äôs arm, pinning him against the wall behind him.\r\n\r\nWhen the smoke cleared, we had three dead perps, and two very scared prisoners. My partner was wounded but he would live to fight another day. The company goons came in fast by chopper, to cover up the situation. The two remaining perps were supposedly flown to a company-run detention center, and we never found out what happened to them, or why they made such a vicious attack. \r\n\r\n<BOLD> My belief is that they were planning to hijack the coveted Mortal Kombat arcade cabinet. \r\n\r\nThe remaining mall customers and employees were paid off to cover their emotional distress and to keep their mouths shut.

I tried to kill myself in January, got out of mental treatment centers in February, and now it\'s March. \r\n\r\nWe\'re at my cousin\'s house, which is about 3000 miles away and we\'ll be here for a week. \r\n\r\nWe were at my cousin\'s birthday party and my mom had a lot to drink, which usually makes her happier, but this time it just pissed her off. She was flipping out over small shit and then when we got home she told me to take her purse upstairs. I did. Then she told me to get her phone from upstairs. I did. Then, she told me to get her glasses from upstairs. I did. Then she told me to bring her shoes upstairs and get my slippers for her to wear, which were in the basement. I brought the shoes up, but I didn\'t want to go all the way downstairs for a friggin pair of slippers so I just brought her a pair of her own. She started yelling at me about how I had been such a bitch all day-- All week, in fact. \r\n\r\nI went downstairs and packed my laptop and stuff so I could go outside and get the hell away from her. When I came back up, my mom wasn\'t there, but my aunt was. I told her to tell my mom how sorry I was, that I should\'ve just gotten the friggin slippers. She said it was just because my mom had been drinking. But I knew that wasn\'t the reason. She was just like this. It\'s just how life goes. \r\n\r\nI realized I couldn\'t find my phone and while I was looking for it, my mom came back and asked me what the hell I was doing. I told her. She just said ""Jesus fucking Christ"", rolled her eyes, and stormed off. She muttered something else to my aunt, but I couldn\'t hear. I was mortified and by the time I finally found my phone, all I wanted to do was kill myself. \r\n\r\nAnother small, but embarrassing thing that happened took place at that party. My mom and my aunt started fighting about whether or not we should be allowed to have a glass of wine. My mom said yes, my aunt said she was a bad parent, my mom relented. Then, my aunt started talking about how alcohol use early in life leads to alcohol abuse later in life. I made a joke about ""What if I don\'t intend on living that long?"" \r\n\r\nI didn\'t mean it or anything. I\'m just used to making jokes like that with my friends and I didn\'t even think about it. She got all serious and started guilt-tripping me. I was so embarrassed. A while later, my mom came over and told me to apologize to her for being such a bitch. I refused my mom\'s orders for once. I was too mortified to do that. \r\n\r\nNow, here\'s where I should probably mention something. I have a condition called Premenstrual Dysphoria Disorder (PMDD). So, although I\'m pretty much incapable of getting mad most days, about two/three days before my period, I just fucking lose it. And of course, I\'m about two/three days away from my period. \r\n\r\nOn days like this, I try to stay away from people as much as possible because hurting someone\'s feelings just makes me feel one thousand times worse. So, I went outside and sat in the side yard so no one could see me. \r\n\r\nI started off just crying, but it turned into sobbing and punching the ground. I was so done with life. I was begging God to just tell me what They wanted, what I had to do to make Them happy. I was so scared. And right as I was starting to calm down a bit, I looked up and saw someone in the window-- I now know it was my aunt, though that\'s what I figured originally anyways. \r\n\r\nI didn\'t think much of it. She knew I was going through a lot. I figured she probably wouldn\'t say anything. A while later my cousin came out to talk to me and, though she didn\'t really understand, I felt better. At least now I had someone to talk to. I wasn\'t just listening to the thoughts bounce back and forth through my head. \r\n\r\nI stayed out for a while after my cousin left and wrote a bit. I feel good. Hopeful. When I went back inside, it was still awkward, but I was okay. Again, hopeful. \r\n\r\nLater, my mom called me downstairs. She said that my aunt had seen me punching the ground. \r\n\r\n""Who the fuck does that at fourteen?"" she asked. I have never felt so stupid in my entire life. I was just trying to find a way to take out my anger. I was just trying not to hurt anyone. But somehow this was worse. The suicide thoughts came back. \r\n\r\nAfter writing this, I feel a bit better. More sorted, I guess. Sorry, this was long. I just needed a safe space to be honest about my shitshow of a life. I still feel stupid and melodramatic, but I honestly don\'t care right now. It could\'ve been a lot worse. I could have tried to kill myself again, like I wanted to. I\'d say punching the grass a few times was probably a better option. \r\n\r\nThanks if you actually read this. \r\n\r\nPeace & Strength, \r\n\r\n-KC\r\n\r\nUPDATE: \r\n\r\nI just talked to my mom (and by talked, I mean was sucked into a conversation where I just nod and agree and imagine shooting myself through the skull), she said my aunt had called it ""weird"", ""childish"", and ""immature"". She had no right to judge me. Punching the ground isn\'t as bad as punching your kid, so my mom shouldn\'t be saying shit. And my aunt knew, too, so she shouldn\'t either. I\'m so fucking done with people. I\'m sorry I\'m not who you want me to be! I\'m fucking trying! I couldn\'t do it today! I wanted to die! Why don\'t you care about that?! I\'m sorry I fucking embarrassed you! Why don\'t you ask me why, though?! I just wanted someone to give a shit. Once my cousin came out and actually made me remembered there was someone here that didn\'t fucking hate me, I felt a little better. That\'s all I needed. It\'s not that fucking hard. I dunno. I think I might just kill myself after vacations over. I\'m done with this shit. \r\n\r']",NB

For some people, there‚Äôs nothing wrong, it‚Äôs just not their thing. (Maybe due to their personality, their preference, or maybe due to abuse, trauma, insecure attachment styles, etc.) And that‚Äôs ok, we have to accept people where they are, although it might be a dealbreaker for you, as I think it is for me. If it\'s a deal breaker for you, & she\'s not willing to have these types of discussions or compromise, you might have to walk away, OP. \r\n\r\nRhetorical questions for thought:\r\nWhere do you live? Is it a conservative or progressive area? What are the attitudes on non-heteronormativity? How did each of you grow up? Did you know anyone LGBTQ+? How long have each of you known you are bi? What has been your romantic/sexual/intimate/sensual experience with other genders? Are each of you affectionate with friends or family?\r\nIs it her first relationship at all, or same-gender relationship? Both of those bring challenges, but I think non-hetero relationships bring a unique extra layer. Things have gotten a little better these days, representation-wise, but many of us grew up with little-to-no representation of not only our identities, but the types of relationships & connections we can have as that person. We‚Äôre drowning in examples of heteronormativity all around us, but what does a girl/girl relationship look like? What does it feel like? How do people react when they see affection between two girls? Is it safe? What will my parents & friends think? Who opens the door?? Who pays for dinner?!? :p\r\n\r\nAnd that can really fuck with you, having no baseline or reference points, not really being able to comfortably integrate your identity with the world yet. Even if you are in the most affirming, supportive environment ever, the first time is usually a bit of a trip, for anything. \r\n\r\nThere is a saying in the polyamorous community, ‚Äúmove at the pace of the slowest camel‚Äù. This can backfire, of course, but in general.... you can‚Äôt force comfort or speed. What I‚Äôd encourage you to do, is be supportive of whatever she needs. Talk about it, but not in a way where it sounds like this is something wrong with her. Empower her thru consent. Consent is sexy, it is confidence-building, it is validating. Talk, in excruciating detail, about what she is and isn‚Äôt comfortable doing in private, & what she is and isn‚Äôt comfortable with in public. Is it situational? Does she want you to ask before you do anything so she can let you know if she‚Äôs feeling it at that time? If she says no, try with all your might not to take it personally. It‚Äôs not about you. But let her know that maybe she could say something reassuring at that time, if that would help you. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want to hold hands right now. But I‚Äôm really glad we‚Äôre together, & I‚Äôm looking forward to cuddling later at home.‚Äù\r\n\r\nTalk about this because you care about her, because you want to be supportive, because you want to know everything about her, because her needs & her comfort are important to you. But also let her know if physical affection is a need of yours, & ask if she‚Äôs willing to try to work towards it, in baby steps, at her pace. You‚Äôre allowed to have needs too. ‚ÄúMaybe when we go out to the movies tonight, could I try to hold your hand, in the dark?‚Äù Sometimes knowing in advance can take the edge off. \r\n\r\nMaybe explain how it makes you feel when she doesn\'t accept affection (phrase this like ""I feel <BOLD-ITALIC> <ITALIC> , when you ."" Trust that her intentions are not malicious. I bet she isn\'t trying to hurt you. Maybe she doesn\'t even know that\'s happening.) Explain what affection means to you, what you get from it. This may require some introspection on your part. Why is public affection important to you? Are you looking for external validation? Are you so overflowing with love/attraction/closeness that it bursts out of you? Would you be ok with only doing it in private?\r\n\r\nMaybe there are other ways she can communicate those things (there are 5+ love languages), & you can learn to receive them.\r\n\r\nI‚Äôm saying maybe a lot because I don‚Äôt know your situation or much about either of you. You‚Äôll have to figure out what the best approach is for you. Good luck!! üåàüåà', 'We also put up with their behavior because it is a confirmation of our fears. Avoidant and anxious are drawn to each other because it works both ways on this. Our fear is that our partner will be distant, won‚Äôt be there when we need them, will leave us, etc. An avoidant person‚Äôs unchecked behaviors confirm those fears for us. So in a twisted kind of way, it feels comfortable that we are right and we know what to expect.\r\n\r\nAs an anxious person, dating a secure or anxious person, can feel very different. We won‚Äôt get that same strong feeling of desperate longing for them, as we do with avoidants. It might feel a little boring & not engaging, because of the lack of conflict & chasing. They‚Äôre just there for you. So we might tell ourselves it‚Äôs not real love or we aren‚Äôt into them.

Sexual orientation and romantic orientation are separate things. They are often aligned towards the same gender(s) for folks, so that\'s become the normative thought that they are the same. Our language reflects this, since most of the time, you only hear people labeling themselves with the sexuality label or with them combined together (i.e. gay, lesbian, homosexual, bisexual). But plenty of folks have differing orientations, & if we wanted to be clear we would describe them both: bisexual heteroromantic, homosexual, panromantic, asexual panromantic, etc.\r\n2. There are indeed a few forms of asexuality that are like ""I sort of feel this attraction, but don\'t want to act on it"" (example: lithosexual/lithoromatic). There is also ""aesthetic attraction"", which is ""I really like looking at them, they are so hot/attractive, I don\'t wanna do anything more than just look.""\r\n3. I also think @<DESCRIPTION> <LINK> also makes a very possible point about growing up in Society. This is a piece of why it can take some/many folks many years to figure out their sexuality. If we grow up being surrounded by only heterosexual models of relationships, it might take us longer to learn that we aren\'t heterosexual, because we don\'t have examples around to look at and be like, ""I want that"", ""That feels right to me"".']",NB

With such a major revenue stream drying up almost entirely, finding ways to continue supporting artists in the coming months is now an urgent priority for anyone who cares about music and the artists who create it. The good news is that we‚Äôre already seeing many fans going above and beyond to support artists across Bandcamp.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> To raise even more awareness around the pandemic‚Äôs impact on musicians everywhere, we‚Äôre waiving our revenue share on sales this Friday, March 20 (from midnight to midnight Pacific Time), and rallying the Bandcamp community to put much needed money directly into artists‚Äô pockets.\r\n\r\nFor many artists, a single day of boosted sales can mean the difference between being able to pay rent or not. Still, we consider this just a starting point. Musicians will continue to feel the effects of lost touring income for many months to come, so we‚Äôre also sharing some ideas below on how fans can support the artists they love and how artists can give fans new, creative ways to provide support.\r\n\r\nIt may sound simple, but the best way to help artists is with your direct financial support, and we hope you‚Äôll join us on Friday and through the coming months as we work to support artists in this challenging time.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Ethan Diamond  \r\n<BOLD> Co-Founder & CEO  \r\n<BOLD> Bandcamp\r\n\r\nüì∑\r\n\r\n<HEADING>  If you‚Äôre a fan\r\n\r\nWe recognize that plenty of music fans are also seeing their livelihoods disrupted by this virus, but if you‚Äôre lucky enough to be in a position to spare some funds (or find yourself in that position in the coming months), please consider sharing your good fortune by buying music and merchandise directly from artists on Bandcamp. This Friday, March 20th, Bandcamp‚Äôs share of sales will also go to the artists and labels you choose to support, and as always, it will reach them in 24-48 hours.\r\n\r\nIf you already have all the music and merchandise you want from your favorite artists, consider discovering new favorites via our editorial publication, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> and let them make their own selections. \r\n\r\nFinally, most of the items on Bandcamp have an option to pay more than the asking price, and leave a note for the artist. A tip and words of support are always appreciated, but especially so now.""\r\n\r\n<HEADING>  If you‚Äôre an artist\r\n\r\nStart by taking a look at <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> may be particularly useful right now, as you look to replace income you‚Äôve lost from canceled tours and shows.\r\n\r\nWe‚Äôre telling everyone with a Bandcamp fan account about Friday‚Äôs event, but please help us spread the word via your usual social channels. You can also use the <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> to message your followers about it.\r\n\r\nMany of your fans are actively looking for ways to support you through this crisis. Even if you don‚Äôt have new music or merch, we know fans love live recordings and early demos, and this is a good time to dig those up and release them on Bandcamp. We‚Äôre also seeing artists offering music production services, as well as video hangouts, lessons, and gear tutorials (these can all be listed as merch items on Bandcamp). Over the coming weeks we‚Äôll collect examples of what‚Äôs working best and share those here, so if something is especially effective for you or you‚Äôre just excited about an idea, please [let us know](mailto:supportingartists@bandcamp.com).\r\n\r\nP.S. Many others within the music industry are being impacted as well, including record store owners and staff, tour managers, event producers, venue staff, lighting and sound professionals, janitors, photographers, bartenders, security guards, and more. We encourage you to find ways to reach out and support those affected in your local communities.\r\n\r\nP.P.S.

bmurph101,"['Why has Unarmed not gotten nerfed <BOLD> at all since launch? \n Unarmed weapons currently:\r\n\r\n\\- Have amongst the highest base damage (Powerfist/DCG) for melee weapons (not even counting the puncturing/extra claw mod). They might be the highest.  \r\n\\- Attack faster than both 1h/2h weapons (but do more damage). The difference is certainly more noticeable compared to 2h weapons but they are slightly faster than 1h weapons.  \r\n\\- Require \\*\\*SIGNIFICANTLY\\*\\* less perk investment compared to 1h/2h (3 vs 9) to fully optimize damage. This is because unarmed gets to double-dip in mutations with both Talons and Twisted Muscles.  \r\n\\- Allows the player to take \\*\\*BOTH\\*\\* of the top defense-related cards under strength \\*\\*WITHOUT\\*\\* compromising your damage output. In order to maximize your damage output for 1h/2h, you need to forgo some sort of offensive power (whether it be raw damage, armor penetration, or swing speed). Unarmed does not require any of this.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMy build (for a raw numbers comparison) for the two ""end game"" weapons for Unarmed and 1h (Powerfist + Shishkebab, respectively):  \r\n\\- 41 Str with Adrenal Reaction + Nerd Rage + All 3 Gladiator cards (60%) + Bloody Mess (15%). Both of these weapons are Bloodied.\r\n\r\nShishkebab (with extra flame jets mod) Damage:  \r\n\\- 543 (physical) + 303 (energy) = 846 total damage\r\n\r\nPowerfist (with puncturing mod) \\*\\*without speccing into Iron Fist or having the Talons mutation\\*\\*:  \r\n\\- 1431 (physical) + 0 (energy) = 1431 total damage\r\n\r\n\\*\\*That\'s right. With ZERO perk investment and its major damage booster (Talons) missing from my build, I can do nearly TWICE the damage with a Powerfist\\*\\*\r\n\r\nBy simply investing in the iron fist card:  \r\n\\- 1431 --> 1798 damage. \\*\\*It\'s important to note that while receiving this damage boost, I\'m also able to take Blocker (45% damage reduction in melee combat) and Barbarian (+80 DR). So I do MORE than twice as much damage while also being FAR more survivable.\\*\\*\r\n\r\nHow is this a thing? I normally am a fan of buffing things that are underpowered as opposed to nerfing things that are powerful, but seriously? Even with a 100% buff to the 1h weapons you would be stuck at the \\*\\*SAME\\*\\* level of damage as an Unarmed player but without the two major defensive perks.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, fix the Shishkebab from doing split damage. Make it all physical and actually give it a fire DoT (a la FO3/FNV).\r\n\r\nTLDR; Unarmed is outrageously OP and needs to be nerfed. 1h weapons need to be buffed significantly (literally twice their damage values) in order to be viable.', 'Then you spend 1% of your time doing endgame stuff.

ISTJScorpio95,"['Hey, have you heard of/joined <SUBREDDIT> yet? We are currently at 398 members, just 2 away from 400! :)', 'Part 2 (A deep-dive into the multiple parallels between Glimmer and Cassandra):\r\n\r\nAfter watching most episodes twice and thinking more about it, Glimmer and Cassandra have more similarities than people realize (imo).\r\n\r\nLife experiences: Their beginnings/upbringings may be different, but what they have gone through as teenagers and young women are very similar. The way I see it, both Glimmer and Cass are women characters who are largely misunderstood, overlooked, underestimated, and underrated not just by the fans, but by other characters in their respective shows (just to name a few for both: Glimmer by Angella, Adora, Bow, and Castaspella; Cass by Rapunzel, Eugene, the Captain of the Guards, and Adira). Also, both are mainly known as ‚Äúsidekicks‚Äù to the main character: Glimmer to Adora and Cass to Raps. Largely due to this, both feel a need to ‚Äústep out of the shadows‚Äù and prove themselves. This can lead to far-reaching/dangerous consequences as we can clearly see in both series. For example, both are easily manipulated/gaslighted by shady figures: Glimmer by Shadow Weaver and Cass by Zhan Tiri. Basically, both Glimmer and Cass‚Äô actions are driven by good intentions, but can end up having bad impacts (a very relatable aspect to me). Finally, both Glimmer and Cass have wielded/used the full power of their in-universe‚Äôs version of the Moonstone, confirming they have strong affinities with the Moon/lunar-related powers.\r\n\r\nPersonality: Both Glimmer and Cass are brave, strong, tough, and smart women who are also temperamental/hot-headed and stubborn/headstrong. At their core, they are fighters who never give up. Both women have persistence, perseverance, and resilience that is unrivaled when compared to other characters. Case in point, Glimmer and Cass have that ‚Äústubborn courage‚Äù/‚Äúdeterminator‚Äù attitude as they are facing opponents in battle (which we see many examples of in both series): when the going gets tough, they will keep on fighting until they can‚Äôt any longer (this is a winning attitude in my book).\r\n\r\nPhysical appearance: Both Glimmer and Cass are fairly short women (around 5 feet tall or so) with short hair in a ‚Äúbob-style‚Äù. Additionally, both have/had ‚Äúunnaturally colored irl‚Äù hair. In five seasons of <ITALIC> SPoP, Glimmer has pink/purple hair with sparkles. Meanwhile, Cass‚Äô hair was turquoise blue at the end of S2 and during S3 of <ITALIC> TTS/RTA. Going even further, Cass and Glimmer have notable costume changes as their own series progresses, signifying dynamic character development. Cass does have more wardrobe/outfit changes than Glimmer, but my point still stands.\r\n\r\nSexual Orientation: Based on evidence throughout both series and posts by show staff on social media, it is safe to say that Glimmer and Cass are LGBT+ women. Glimmer appears to be bisexual because she has shown interest in both women (i.e., cuddling with Adora in a Mystacor spa, kissing Catra on the cheek, and hugging both women) as well as men (her friendship with Bow that became a romantic relationship as the hugs turned to kisses over time). Even though it was never confirmed in <ITALIC> TTS/<ITALIC> RTA itself, I think we can definitely infer that Cass is LGBT+. Now, whether Cass is lesbian or bisexual is currently up for debate, because while she has shown an interest in men (which may have actually been a ruse), she seems to be much more interested in women (specifically Rapunzel), even though it may be an intense unrequited/one-sided type of love.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the parallels between Glimmer and Cass are numerous.\r\n\r\nThese are just the ones that I can remember off the top of the head.', 'This is a poll question. Just want to make sure that people who see this know (you may need to go back and come back again/refresh your screen).', 'Same here!

So, I finally gave it a chance back in Feb. and boy was I not disappointed! You are exactly right! This series is definitely one of, if not, the best of all time mainly because of its characters (development, relatability, etc.) and reasonable plots.\r\n\r\nGlimmer is my favorite character because we have so much in common. Due to this, I can relate to her much more than any other character. Catra is my second-favorite character because of her development and story arc. In a nutshell, Glimmer and Catra are my two favorite characters because they are complex/complicated, dynamic, and relatable.']",M

My snoot is a bit sore the next few days, but it's nowhere near as bad as when I initially got it pierced.\r\nAs for the wait, I can't give you an exact time period, but I've had my septum pierced for about 8 months before I started stacking, so it definitely had time to fully heal.\r\n\r\nIt depends on the look you want though. If you want to wear multiple rings in your septum, this would be the way to go, but if you just want to wear a single piece of jewelry in a larger gauge, stacking isn't ideal, because the shape created by stacking is a different shape than the one created by using traditional methods.\r\nThese are just my experiences, in case that's something you'd be interested in doing.""]",NB

Crystrons play more as a reactive counter deck and rely greatly on your experience to identify openings in your opponent's deck, so researching or even playing the other meta decks helps a ton.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is to not get too attached to your boss monsters, no matter how awesome Quariongandrax looks; as mentioned in my other comment, their Synchros are essentially vanilla beaters after their summon, so don't be afraid to destroy them yourself to clear your field and utilize their float.

This is especially devastating if you Black Rose the field along with Quariongandrax."", ""I appreciate the down to earth and no BS approach he has towards cards. He acknowledges they're good, if they are, but doesn't overhype them. People tend to forget that a single great card doesn't immediately boost its respective archetype, if any, to Tier 0 status. Guardians can get a new card that searches every single Equip and allows you to ignore their restrictions, but I doubt they're gonna be meta relevant with just that.\r\n\r\nOn that note, I'm mixed about how he mostly talks about cards in-archetype. On one hand, I enjoy it because he's talking about the card and how it was meant to be used, and how it interacts with the cards it was designed to support. On the other, sometimes it undersells the card. For the most part, though, I'd say I prefer that he keeps it to those immediately relevant so as not to bloat the video (also because I doubt he wants to bother thinking about every single deck that could theoretically use it).\r\n\r\nSometimes I feel he's unnecessarily nitpick-y, and I don't mean when he shit talks bad cards. I recall him talking about D/D/D Gilgamesh (which was decent to him), saying how it would've been more accurate to read 1 D/D Synchro, Fusion, or Pendulum monster because nobody's gonna summon an Xyz monster due to them not having material this way. While he is correct and did admit he was being so pedantic about it, it kinda felt like a pointless rant since 1) if it doesn't make any functional difference, why bother bloating the text by specifying the three monster types, 2) it's arguably better to have the option to do so anyway even if it won't happen often enough to matter, and 3) it could be future proofing for future Extra Deck monster types that D/D/D may or may not get. Ironically, I might be unnecessarily nitpicking that part of some of his videos.\r\n\r\nOverall, I like him and his content. Quick, concise, and surface-to-mid breakdowns of cards. Some people might prefer in-depth analysis of cards instead of just talking about them in-house, which is fine, but for the most part, I enjoy just surface level reviews of new cards (though I'm not opposed to him making quick shout outs to other archetypes that can make use of it). Usually when I want something deeper, I go to deck breakdowns instead of individual card reviews since it's much easier for me to appreciate and comprehend their impact that way.""]",M

I've since been operated on, been on hefty pain meds and I'm doing my physiotherapy 3x a day.\r\n\r\nAnyway, since this, I have been able to keep up my workouts and my dad bod is coming back.

Sounds like it was written by a deep 14 years old."", 'How incel theory can be disproven using game theory \n Incel theory is internally inconsistent and can be disproven using reverse game theory\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Introduction: \r\n\r\nI was talking to a friend of mine before econ class, and somehow the topic turned to <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. So we\'re talking about them, then he says these words:\r\n\r\n""Incels are just dudes with no game.""\r\n\r\nWriting it out mathematically, the statement becomes, ""If you are an incel, you are a dude with no game"", so the <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> to give them ""game"", it would be completely ineffective, as the incel mindset is, at its core, anti-woman. At the basis of the ideology is a fundamental objectification of women, simply turning them into objects of use, and hence an incel would likely use that ""game"" to commit harm against women.\r\n\r\nSo we can\'t use ""game"", but still, how can we help incels, or at least prevent other people from believing their ideology and becoming incels themselves?\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> Teach all people reverse game theory, also known as mechanism design. \r\n\r\n<HEADING> Background: \r\n\r\nImmediately, the question is why teaching people mechanism design will help with the incel problem. This is because incel theory has a huge mechanism design flaw. \r\n\r\nSee, according to incel theory, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> simply out to use and harm men.\r\n\r\nThat is bad economics, specifically bad mechanism design. Using the aforementioned assumptions, we will prove that incel theory is internally inconsistent.\r\n\r\n<HEADING> The Model: \r\n\r\nLet\'s create the setting. We have one lady, whom we will denote as W. There are N guys who are attracted to her, and want to become her boyfriend. She will only have one boyfriend. \r\n\r\nThe key thing to note is that <ITALIC> each guy does not know how much he actually values a relationship a relationship with W. This is because W may seem great in public, but in private and in a relationship she may be completely different. Maybe she\'s just putting on an act, like incel theory states.\r\n\r\nSo the guys don\'t know their exact values (V) of a relationship with W, but they have expected values (E(V)), which are dependent on a signal (S) they each receive about W. Maybe the signal is a rumor they heard about her, an Instagram post, whatnot.\r\n\r\nWe will assume that signals are positively correlated with values. In other words, a high/low signal means it\'s more likely that a guy\'s true value of a relationship with W will be high/low. Furthermore, we will assume that each guy\'s signals and values are ""affiliated"" with the others\'. In other words, the higher other guys\' signals/values are, the more likely you will have a high signal/value. We can say that in this model, values are interdependent and not independent. Furthermore, signals are drawn from the same distribution for each guy. Finally, every guy is risk-neutral.\r\n\r\nLet\'s take the point of view of one guy who likes W, and there are N-1 other guys. We will let S denote the signal of this guy and Y<ITALIC> i denote the i-th highest signal of the other N-1 guys. So Y1 is the highest signal of the others, Y<ITALIC> 2 is the 2nd-highest, and so on, until Y{N-1} is the N-1 highest of the others, i.e. the lowest.\r\n\r\nNow let\'s use the incel assumptions to construct the mechanism that decides who becomes W\'s boyfriend. Accordingly, W is purely materialistic, shallow, and in general a bad person. She only cares about what the guys can do for her, be it buying her food, clothes, and whatnot. Hence, she will only enter a relationship with the guy who is willing to spend the most money on her (maybe there are other things she wants too, but if so let\'s just take the <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> to combine those things into one value). This means that each guy will keep trying to do the others in terms of how much they spend on her (assuming that budget constraints do not bind). As each guy declares how much money he will spend on W, this ""raises the cost"" of a relationship with W. Eventually, there will come a point where the expected utility from being in a relationship with W will be negative; this occurs for a guy when the cost is too high. And so he drops out. More and more guys drop out, until there are only 2 guys left in this spending game. Finally, one of the guys will raise the cost just too high for the other guy, and so the other guy drops out, and thus the guy who raised the cost becomes W\'s boyfriend. The cost to W\'s boyfriend is thus the point at which the second-to-last guy dropped out.\r\n\r\nYou may notice that this mechanism sounds almost exactly like W setting up an <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> in equilibrium for independent private values; specifically, the equilibrium cost at which a winner wins is the same across both auctions. However, values here are interdependent, so equilibrium is not exactly the same. However, I will examine the second-price case, because the qualitative result is the same, and it\'s also easier. Just for robustness though, we\'ll discuss how the final qualitative result holds when analyzing the English auction perspective.\r\n\r\nNow, return to the guy whose POV we are taking. Let <DESCRIPTION> <LINK> be his expected value of a relationship, condition on his signal equaling some $x$, and all the other guys\' signals being whatever they are. \r\n\r\nHowever, remember the setting! If this guy wins, he pays the cost at which the last person among the others dropped out. Furthermore, signals and values are correlated, and due to the symmetry assumption from above, we have that the highest signal equals the highest expected value of a relationship. This means that our specific guy only cares about the signal of the person with the highest signal among the others, because the cost at which that guy drops out is the cost our guy pays. So we can rewrite the condition expected value <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>, for some signal y.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will let b^*(x) denote the cost one pays if he becomes W\'s boyfriend, given that his signal is x. So in the second-price sealed bid auction setting, since we are assuming risk neutrality here, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. Let\'s draw a graph!\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nLet\'s suppose our guy shares that signal. Then his cost function will <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nNext, we\'ll graph the expected value of a relationship, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. Notice that this doesn\'t start at 0, since one\'s own signal is positive, so even if others\' signals are 0, one will have positive expected value. Right now we won\'t prove why the slope is less than that of the b function; we\'ll shiow that later. But the intuition, I think, is clear: your own signal has a higher effect on you than others\' signals, and while your own signal is constant in the expected value function, it changes with y in the b function. So the b function has a greater slope.\r\n\r\nNow, remember that all the guys are risk neutral, meaning our guy only wants to win when expected value is greater than or equal to cost, or lose when expected value is less than cost. <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. This shows that the slope of the b function is greater than that of the expected value function when S = x.\r\n\r\nAnyways, because of the previous observation, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. So, what is the ramification?\r\n\r\nWell, because of everything we have shown in the graph\'s thus far, we can define b^*(x) in terms of condition expected value: <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. In other words, for each guy, it is an optimal strategy to act as though everyone else has the same signal as he does, so as to guarantee that he drops out when the cost goes too high, but stays in when it hasn\'t reached that point yet!\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Proving the Internal Inconsistency of Incel Theory: \r\n\r\nSupposedly, it is in W\'s interest to lie and hide her true nature from the guys. But does that actually hold, assuming <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>?\r\n\r\nLet\'s say that W will also get a signal about herself. She can commit to one of two plans: Plan A is to reveal the signal, and Plan B is to not reveal the signal. Remember, her goal is to extract the largest cost out of the guys as possible. So given this objective, which plan is optimal?\r\n\r\nWell, let\'s define new variables. Let X<ITALIC> i define the i-th highest signal overall. So for example, if we take the perspective of the guy with the highest signal, then his signal is X1, but Y<ITALIC> 1 is the next-highest signal, i.e. Y1 = X_2 in this case.\r\n\r\nLet us also define S<ITALIC> W to be the signal that W can choose to revealing or not revealing. Suppose that SW = w. Then if she chooses to reveal it, a guy with signal x will act according to the above, while also taking into account W\'s signal, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nIncel theory dictates that W\'s optimal strategy is to commit to not reveal her signal. Now, you may know of the <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>, which will tell you whether or not incel theory is correct. But we will do a direct proof here. spoiler: incel theory is wrong, and it is actually W\'s optimal strategy to commit to revealing her signal.\r\n\r\nNow we know that W\'s benefit comes from the cost at which the guy with the second-highest signal drops out. So let us take the perspective of the guy with the second-highest signal.\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nNext, we will use the <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nNext, since the outside conditions have your signal and the highest among the others equal to x, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nNext, we know that we are looking from the perspective of the person with the second-highest signal, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nNow we shake things up. Suppose that the highest signal of the others is greater than or equal to x. Since all the guys\' signals and values are affiliated, it means that now, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nNext, <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>, since S = X_2 = x already implies that the highest signal among the others\' is greater than or equal to x.\r\n\r\nFinally, we know we\'re looking at the guy with the second-highest signal, so <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.\r\n\r\nWhat did we just prove? Remember that the cost W gets from her boyfriend is the cost at which the guy with the second-highest signal dropped out, i.e. his reservation cost. Hence, this proof shows that the reservation cost of the guy with the second-highest signal <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>! QED.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> In other words, it is optimal for W to commit to revealing her signal, which proves that incel theory is internally inconsistent with its assumptions!\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Discussion: \r\n\r\nThe intuition is that the second-highest reservation cost underestimates the true value to that guy of a relationship with W, since the guy with the second-highest signal operates under the assumption that the highest signal among the others equals his. This is false, though, as the highest of the other signals is greater than his, and if he knew that, then his expected value would increase. Hence, by committing to revealing S_W, W corrects for this underestimate and raises, on average, the second-highest reservation cost. This is because her signal is affiliated with the highest other signal.\r\n\r\nNow let\'s loop back to the English perspective. Using the Linkage Principle, it can be proved that English case has an expected cost greater than or equal to the second-price case. Furthermore, W revealing her signal yields the same qualitative result: this is more beneficial to her than hiding her signal.\r\n\r\nHence, teaching people mechanism design will showcase this internal inconsistency in incel theory.\r\n\r\nIncel theory is bad, and now we know that not only is it bad morally, but economically as well.', 'TIL that in the 16th and 17th century, erectile dysfunction was a crime in France and was ground for divorce.

The only bit I really understand is Damon‚Äôs reference to producer Fatboy Slim (this is the second of two songs he produced on the album) and to the Moroccan barn where much of the album was recorded.\r\n\r\nMusically the song does show the influence of Fatboy Slim through being one of the more dance orientated tracks on the album. It is far from conventional however, as we get plenty of strange sound effects and some funk influenced guitar work that we‚Äôve never really seen Blur utilise before. Alex and Dave again play important roles in the song, with the use of drum machines adding some electronic percussion typical of Fatboy Slim.

idkwhattoputhere000,"['Trip: I had a spiritual experience, wherein I feel I saw the ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù of the universe \n Last night, I had what I believe to be a spiritual experience with psilocybin. A close friend and I took a dose 15 gr of Valhalla truffels (yay, Netherlands) and off we went; it was the third time for me. \n\nThe trip started within 20 mins of taking it, since I‚Äôm sensitive to all sorts of substances, and in the beginning it was nothing out of the ordinary: we were watching a movie while waiting for it to kick in and it started to distort what I was seeing. Faces were weird, the colors were more vivid etc. So far, so good. Quick note before I continue: in this period in my life, I‚Äôm extremely focused on developing myself, which leads to reading a lot - right now I‚Äôm devouring Jung‚Äôs book and trying to get to the bottom of both the psyche and the spiritual aspect thereof - and meditating every day. So, when it finally kicked in for both of us, we decided to meditate. \n\nI put on some soothing music and we laid down to meditate. The meditation started with a feeling of bliss, as if I was close to something that made me feel an extreme feeling of love and warmth around my diaphragm; I didn‚Äôt see it, I didn‚Äôt think of it, but I felt it. \n\nNow, I‚Äôm a talker during things like this, so as soon as I felt something, I would want to philosophize about it and try to get to the bottom of it. My friend didn‚Äôt appreciate this however, so I soon shut up. Suddenly not long thereafter, it felt as if I transcended (for a lack of a better word to describe it) to a place where I came even close to the source where this bliss was coming from; it was a place where time and space as we know it didn‚Äôt exist and I wasn‚Äôt alone there. These entities didn‚Äôt seem strange to me, but it felt as if we knew each other. I didn‚Äôt talk to them, but somehow we were communicating, although I can‚Äôt remember what it was about. I do remember asking questions like: ‚ÄúWhat are we on earth for? Why do I have to go back? How can I take what I see here back to the ‚Äúearthly realm‚Äù (literally)? I don‚Äôt remember the answer to the questions, except to the last one, to which I myself replied: write this down. \n\nBeing the lazy person that I am, I didn‚Äôt bother to get up and stayed in this space for a while, letting the trip continue. At some point - I don‚Äôt remember how I got there - I saw what I describe as the ‚Äúmachinery‚Äù of the universe, with cogs and gears everywhere; however, these cogs and gears weren‚Äôt as archaic as the ones we have on this earth: they ran smoother than anything I‚Äôve ever seen in this life. It seemed as if it was a hypermodern ‚Äúcity,‚Äù except what I saw weren‚Äôt buildings, but more like building blocks of something greater and it had a blue aura to it. Suddenly, it was as if these building blocks all got stretched out and I could see ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù of it all; I saw the concepts of what I think was time, the seasons, the months etc. A sort of blueprint of this machinery. Immediately, my mind told me: ‚Äúso, this is where some of the greatest thinkers got their ideas.‚Äù This was truly one of the strangest things I‚Äôve ever experienced, but at the same time I‚Äôve never felt anything so real. \n\nAfter a while, I felt myself slowly get ‚Äúsucked‚Äù into this reality again and I quickly grabbed my notebook to write these things down. Now, I‚Äôm extremely critical of myself, so while writing I kept asking myself ‚ÄúIs this truly what you saw?‚Äù The reason for this was that I read Jung‚Äôs autobiography where he describes a similar experience, so what if my mind was just projecting his experiences into my own? I kept going back and forth, testing it while writing and coming to the conclusion that I was experiencing this myself. \n\nReading back on all of this, I can imagine how strange this all sounds, but it honestly felt very real. Bear in mind I‚Äôm not religious, but a thought that popped up while coming close to the source of that feeling was: ‚ÄúI can imagine that people see God in this.‚Äù\n\nThe reason I‚Äôm posting this here, is because I want to know if anyone has ever experienced something similar or that my mind made this up.

Lopsided_Kale,"['The thing that\'s working for me is a concept I learnt in computer science: divide and conquer! So Instead of thinking big picture, ""am I trans,"" and getting nowhere, I focus on small pieces that I\'m sure of / can work out my feelings for and then move on to another piece.\n\nFor example, I\'ve been struggling a lot with whether or not I\'m trans mtf, but I know for sure that I don\'t like my body hair or facial hair and I want it gone. That fact alone doesn\'t mean I\'m trans obviously, but it\'s a small piece of the puzzle. I work my way up from there, identifying things I don\'t like about myself and how I would prefer to see them. I want long hair, I want pale and soft skin, I want to wear perfume etc. Each thing alone doesn\'t make me trans, but each one does make me feel more Confident that I am. Breaking things up like this makes you feel like you\'re making progress too, instead of being stuck for ages with a giant question and no answer.\n\nThis all being said, these things are just in relation to myself. By that I mean, if youre fine with body hair or don\'t care about your skin or whatever, it doesn\'t make you any less trans, and vice versa caring about that stuff doesn\'t necessarily make you trans. You have to fit it to your idea of what being your preferred gender would look like or more generally just what your preferred self would look like.

I went outside to let me dogs out and suddenly it just hit me, like, my problems aren\'t that big. I guess that sounds dumb, but going outside and getting some fresh air made me realize that yeah I was nervous now but whether or not that accept me thus will eventually all be in the past, and in the face of the whole world with 7.2 billion people is this really that big a deal? \n\nSo with the thought that ""this isn\'t that big a deal"" I went downstairs, told her I have to tell her something important, and then I realized that it WAS A BIG DEAL.

He also carries them around Lind of like a mother dog would carry her puppies. His favorite toy is a sloth. He will chew on her some. But he mostly prefers to just cuddle with her and lick her. He is half chihuahua and half rat terrier. I got him at 1 years old. He came from a hoarding house. I really don‚Äôt know much else. Other than he is sensitive about his tail and paws being touched as well. I kind of get the sense he might have been mistreated and abused. He is very attached to me, and does not like when I leave. He is slightly protective of me. And a bit protective of balls. He has never bitten anyone, or another dog. But he will bark at them to let them know to back off. I know chihuahuas can be a bit stand offish. But he is very friendly towards other humans, and most dogs. He is just protective of toys at times. But loves the warm comfort of a soft plush toy.

I can not have a normal relationship because I was abused growing up. I was sexually abused. It is all about healing and bonding for me. I am not abusing people. Abusing people is hurting people when they do not have a choice and when they are clearly not into it. I do not do that and do not tolerate that.  When I am doing bdsm my partner does not scream or cry. They moan and experience joy. If you think that is wrong I do not know what to tell you.

My baby sister wanted to see pictures of pigs, so I just looked up the hashtag for it on Instagram and looked through that. I was vegetarian at the time, I didn‚Äôt eat meat and rarely drank milk. I know that means absolutely nothing though, so on with it. I ended up continuously scrolling after she left, and I stumbled upon a slaughterhouse video. I‚Äôd never actually seen them before, I had no idea what it was like. I looked through a few vegan profiles, learning more and watching more videos. I think maybe within the next two weeks after that I watched both Earthlings and that other one about the health impact. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I wanted to be t vegan, but for some reason I couldn‚Äôt just say it. I subtly started eating more vegan foods and nearly nothing else, and by New Years I knew I had to be completely. My dad is vegan, and he cooks a lot, so it wasn‚Äôt too hard to get vegan food, but whenever my mom baked or made pasta and stuff she asked why I didn‚Äôt have any, and yet I still couldn‚Äôt say it. I got sick of just saying I‚Äôm not hungry, and decided the next time I was asked I‚Äôd say the truth, but eventually my mom caught up and found out, probably either the 2nd or 5th of January.

The two that were in the class asked me stupid questions about protein and why I‚Äôm doing it, I for some reason ignored them. Whenever they argued with me for like the first month, I mainly said it was for health reasons, knowing I was lying. I eventually got to arguing about how it‚Äôs not meant for us and shit like that, and hope to be able to get one to be vegan, although unlikely. \r\nI was very similar to them before, they bullied some kid because he ate mostly vegetarian, and I bullied him too, mostly for not actually being one, while they were just being asses.

I know this is normal, but I just realized how much I was missing last night and it feels like I‚Äôm missing a complete part of my person. Does anyone have any advice as to how to process this realization? I know there is no one specific thing that helps everyone, but anything is useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was younger, my parents would argue a lot. My dad would never listen to my mom, he always seemed to treat her like she didn‚Äôt know anything. Anytime my mom would try to call him out on how he treated her, he would make himself cry and play the victim. It all came to a head, when my dad was afraid that my mom was going to leave and take me with her. He called his dad (who did not like my mom because she was ‚Äútoo dark‚Äù and had different (more progressive) beliefs) and they called the cops on my mom. I was four, I had been at my cousin‚Äôs house. I would be picked up and brought to my grandparent‚Äôs where my parents were waiting for me. Not even a mile away from my grandparent‚Äôs house, the cops pulled us over. I remember them asking my parents to step out of the car and after a long time I remember only my dad getting back in. Everything after that starts to blur. I know I was brought back to my grandparent‚Äôs house and I remember crying and screaming and I didn‚Äôt want anyone near me, I just wanted my mom. I found out from my mom yesterday that this occurred right after Christmas. After she was taken (she was not arrested), they just brought her to the station and her brother picked her up. I had no idea of this at the time. There is a whole section of my life after that moment I can‚Äôt remember. My mom was gone for 3 months after that. The only memory I have of those 3 months is when I got to visit my mom again in secret after my dad realized I wasn‚Äôt doing well. I turned 5 during those 3 months, I have no memory of this. I don‚Äôt remember school, or my grandparents, or my dad, or any of my dance classes (which I loved). After those 3 months, my dad let her come back, but she was locked in the house and my grandparents could not know she was there until 3 months later. I also have very little memory of this period. After this all took place, my dad told me not to talk about it. I still had no idea why any of it happened. It wouldn‚Äôt be until several years later I would ask my mom and find out many of the details I had missed out on or just could not remember. Apparently DHS had gotten involved, and the case worker (who talked to me at school at one point and I do vaguely remember that) who was in charge of the case closed it after looking into the situation and realizing that my mom had not done anything wrong. I know my dad was frustrated and said some things to the case worker because I‚Äôve been told that the worker told him he needed to ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù and that my grandfather should ‚Äúmind his own business.‚Äù There is so much more to this. My dad has constantly made me feel like I was wrong for feeling how I do about all of this and even has tried to make it out as though he had ‚Äúno other choice.‚Äù \r\nI could go on, but my main thing is this.

She picked me up and then we sat in the parking lot of Kroger and just talked for about and hour and a half, then we sat in front of my house for another hour and a half or so.

It isn't meant so much for fusing from the GY, but more for giving you 2+ free Proto-Cyber Dragons by cutting your LP then using your Skill. I understand Herald of the Abyss and Cosmic Cyclone serve the same purpose with additional effects, but CFS has the benefit of being searchable with Core and not relying on your opponent (not saying cut the cards I mentioned for it, just that there are some differences).\r\n\r\nYou typically want to have CFS and Cyberload Fusion, with Core acting as substitutes for either one by searching what you're missing, as you instantly have the material for Rampage, so maximizing on them would probably be optimal. For reference, in a 5-card hand, having 3 Cores and 2 CFS gives you an 80.63% chance of opening at least 1 of them (that's roughly 4/5 games), and 3 of each puts you at 87.06%. 3 Cores and 1 CFS currently goes at 71.83%, a little less than 3/4 games. I'd say 2 CFS would be best since it gets kinda bricky at 3 and something something diminishing returns.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I think there are 2 approaches you can take with your support cards. You can go for a more counter-oriented approach with Herald of the Abyss, Floodgate Trap Hole, and Canadia, waiting for your opponent to commit to a play then interrupt them to drain them of resources before going in for the kill, OR for a more surprise swing play with Concentrating Current, Cosmic Cyclone, and other backrow removal to clear the way for your Fusions and prevent your opponent from interrupting them. While it's understandable to want to do both and cover all bases, with low limited the space is, it might help to focus on one approach.\r\n\r\nThe only card I can confidently recommend cutting from your list is Overload Fusion.

I love my family with all my heart and want nothing bad for them, but I'm considering calling 911 on my mother. \r\n\r\nHere is a little background information:\r\n\r\nI'm 20 years old and am non binary. I have been at university for 2 years. I have a 17 year old sister and a 14 year old brother. About 3 years ago now, when I was a junior in high school, my was arrested for stealing from our local Walmart. She was giving my (ex) boyfriend and I a ride home from work (we worked in the same restaurant) and wanted to stop by walmart before we went home. We were followed by a lady with a camera the whole time and my mom just kept telling us not to worry about it. When we went into the parking lot, she approached us and said the police were on their way. My mom flipped her shit and told my bf and I to get into the car. She started driving away, but we only got about abblock before the cops pulled us over. It was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. \r\n\r\nMy dad bailed out my mom and she had to do a bunch of community service and was banned from entering that walmart ever again. \r\n\r\nAbout a month later my parents decided to separate. They still haven't divorced fully but it's been ugly the entire time. I suffered a lot of ill mental health effects due to the stress that was put on me in the following year. I worked 40+ hours a week in a restaurant and went to cosmetology school full time. I paid for all my school and bought a car. I often helped with the bills, water, electric, etc. because my mom quit her job working as a teacher right after my dad moved out. \r\n\r\nI bought almost all the food in the house, cleaned all the time, did everyone's laundry, cooked for my siblings, and was basically their mother for a long time. It got to the point that I signed permission slips for school. When they wanted to go somewhere, they asked me. When they were hungry, they asked me. I reminded them to brush their teeth and helped them with homework. I drove them to school. I took them to doctors appointments and dentist appointments. When they needed lunch money or new shoes or clothes, I got it for them. I worked really, really hard for my junior and senior year of high school. \r\n\r\nAll the while, my mom is drugged tf out. I never knew what she was on but she would go into these blackout rages where she screamed and threw things and hit us until she passed out. She never remembered it in the morning. I always did my best to get my siblings in our room so that I could try to calm her down but sometimes they saw it. \r\n\r\nDad moved out almost immediately after they decided to separate. He took out their 401K and spent it all on a new house. It took him about 7 months to get fully settled and we (my siblings and I) didn't see him much, if at all, the entire time.\r\n\r\nThings started to look up after that. Dad found a really kind girlfriend who made yummy dinners and played nice music during the day. Though it was weird in a new house with a new woman, it was 1000% better than what was happening at moms. \r\n\r\nWe would trade off every week. One week at moms, one week at dads. One week at moms, one week at dads (well, my siblings did this. I lived in a dorm at uni during the school year and came back for summers and other breaks). We did this every week until my mom got evicted from the house about 4 months ago. It was awful. This was the house my grandma raised my mother in, it's the house my siblings and I were raised in. \r\n\r\nWell, after all this, my mom moves in with my grandma (the eviction happened exactly 2 days after mandatory quarantine was put in place by the government). My grandma helped my mom (who still hasn't gotten a job after 3 years except for when she was a bartender for about a month) take out a loan and buy a new house. \r\n\r\nWe officially have this place as of 2 weeks ago and it's looking like it's going to be exactly the same. She has a 26 year old on-and-off boyfriend of 2 years who deals a lot of drugs. Mostly amphetamines, adderall, cocaine and weed. Im not positive, but I have good reason to believe that my mom is some sort of low functioning junkie. She manages to wake up and doddle around all day but that's about it. She hasn't moved anything into the new house except a mattress for herself. The only other stuff in the house is what came with it, like the fridge and the stove. Oh, and there is a lock on two cabinets and while I'm not 100% sure, I'm almost positive that's where her bf stores all of his drugs. \r\n\r\nThis boyfriend shes been dating also has a very large and vicious pit bull who he has trained to attack anyone that isnt him. Its bitten children from just trying to pet it and everytime I come into the house, it barks and tries to run to attack me. If the bf wasn't there to stop him, I'm sure I'd be in the hospital. \r\n\r\nSo obviously, I really dont want my siblings there. I want my mom to get better. The weird part of it is that it's like shes not even my mom. Shes like a whole different person. She offers me and my sister drugs and let's my sister spend the night at her boyfriend's all the time even though he is kind of abusive and very manipulative and my mom knows it. We've even talked about it. \r\n\r\nSo my question is this: should I call the cops on my mother? I love her and I just want her to want to get better. It feels like she isnt even trying and it's very upsetting. \r\n\r\nI fear that one day, some one will come looking for her boyfriend and instead find my siblings. People around here have been known to break into dealers houses and hurt the people inside. I just want them to be safe while I'm at school. I feel like when they are there, no one is looking out for them. No one is making them meals, no one is making sure they brush their teeth and do their homework. No one is making sure they have lunch for the day or clean clothes. No one is watching out for them. \r\n\r\nI'm so so terrified of the possililities that could happen if I continue to sit idly by and watch my mother do this to us. I've tried talking to her multiple times and each time has been completely pointless. I'm so afraid. I'm so so so afraid. I dont want her to go to jail, I just want my siblings to be safe. What can I do? \r\n\r\n\r\ntl;dr my mom has been kind of absent for a while now. Should I call 911 so that my siblings will have to stay with my dad?"", ""I like James Sirius and Lilly Luna.

When he did come, it took us like 40-80 minutes to get there. He frequently lost his erection completely during sex. \nHe acted a bit outraged whenever I tried to seduce him somehow.\nHe had a very stereotypically ""gay"" voice, gestures etc, like from a stereotypical comedy movie. Sometimes he said unexpected things regarding homosexuality, out of the blue, like we\'re sitting in a park on a bench and he starts saying that he had a dream about two gays trying to make love to him (that\'s exactly what he said, he didn\'t use the word rape) and he killed them.\nOk, this one will be silly, but he saw penises everywhere. Like, look, this flower looks like a penis. This animal looks like a penis. Etc.\nHis parents seemed conservative and had a pretty strong views on what ""a real man"" should be like. I think that\'s mostly why he lived in denial.']",F

Katz-withaK,"['Should we have a kid now? \n Long post\n\nMy partner (almost 20 MtF) and I (almost 22 cis F) have been discussing our options when it comes to having kids. We have both been open that we want biological kids together as well as adopt when we are ready. Unfortunately the window for having kids together is closing soon. She has her first appointment for HRT early June and would like to start as soon as she can. HRT will make it so her sperm is infertile. We have considered the option to freeze her sperm for 5 years. We dont have that money ufront so we have saught out help from family as her birthday gift. Unfortunately she does have some transphobic family members who will find about her transition through asking and we might not have as much support as we could from the family. Freezing sperm is also not a guarantee as we would have to use it within the 5 years and it would be less viable than naturally conceiving. \n\nWe have talked about having a kid now. We have both felt an inkling at the back of our heads for about a month to say ""f<HEADING> ck it"" to birth control methods and let\'s have a kid. We discussed it a little bit when it first popped up but left it for a few weeks. Yesterday we had an in depth discussion of where we stand on this issue. \n\nOur relationship is relatively new as we have only been together 4 months and known eachother for about 6 months. We talked a lot in the first two months of getting to know each other and within the first few months of dating we covered big topics such as marriage, future career plans, how we would raise children, etc. We have been living together, sharing a room in a three bdrm apartment for the last 2 months due to quarantine. We have also gone through a period of two weeks of self isolation due to Covid-19 together. We have successfully been able to communicate through it all and we have yet to fight and yell at each other. We have had disagreements but we have been able to work them out without much problem as we have strived for open communication throughout our relationship as well as understanding when it comes to each other\'s emotions. \n\nWe believe that regardless of whether we stay together or not, we would be able to co-parent a kid because of the strong communication skills we share. We have both stated that we aim for marriage in a year and that we see eachother as potential life partners but we are also aware that unforseen events may occur. \n\nWe are both young and in university, my partner is taking a year off to work after graduating from a one year program and I am going into my second year of what will likely be 5 years of school. We know that financially and emotionally it will be hard to maintain school, part time jobs and a child. I am willing to reduce my courseload or take a break to take care of the kid and home as needed but my partner has such a good career ahead of her that she will be continuing on her schooling so that way we can afford a familly.\n\nHer family would also be a great help and support if we had a kid because they are pro life and have a 2 month old right now. We would be able to have hand-me-downs of baby clothing and other stuff like toys. They are also very caring and would likely help out when we need it in terms of caring for the child for some time during exam season and also extra help. They live in the same city as us so it make it easier to ask for help too. \n\nFinancially it would be hard, my partner has a job and I would be finding a job before hand as well. Our student loans would give us a little extra money to get by as we have a dependant under our care as well as the gov helps us out too because we have a child. We would also have at least 9 months to save up to the best of our ability and collect clothing and such. \n\nWe are asking for any advice or opinions or other things we have not considered.

This might get a little long.\n\nI started boxing about 4 and a half years ago, and found I loved it a lot. I found my perfect trainer, I was getting in the ring to practice spar with him, all was good. I was excited for everything I was learning, and happy with how things were going for me.\n\nThis past August I fell in a stupid (non-sport related), incident and broke my elbow. It was one of those freak accidents, wherein I had to fall perfectly in order to do it, but I fractured the radial head in spectacular fashion. To make it worse, the fracture was such that the doctor didn't want me doing any kind of physical activity, he was afraid that the smallest impact, the wrong type of jostle, could sheer off an entire chunk of the bone. I mean, if you're going to do something, do it well, right? \n\nIt's been a really difficult recovery for me, physically and mentally. It was such a slow process, and being away from my sport hurt a lot. \n\nMy trainer has been there every step, though. Including when my doctor thought I might need surgery, and added another 2 months to my recovery time estimate. D called me and told me to meet him at the gym, and sat me down to give me one of the most encouraging talks I've ever gotten. He told me to focus on getting better, and that he'd be there when I was. We'd get me back up to where I'd been. He told me to stay positive, and hopeful. It was obviously more intricate, but this is the gist. \n\nAnyway. The day is looming. I was cleared at the start of January to get back into the regular gym, and slowly build my strength back up. I was also told that mid-February, I could get myself back to boxing. Not full force right away, and not to the amount of days I'd been going. But I can begin to get that rhythm back, get my body used to the moves, hit lightly.\n\nI'm doing it Monday. I'm so happy, and a little bit nervous. Mostly nervous about how it'll feel. 5 months of doctor scare-tactics really stick in the head. I thought it might help to lay this all out here, in a space with like-minded people. Nervous excitement is one of those states that you don't think about much, outside of small dogs, until you're experiencing it.

So, I know being a man does not revolve entirely around having a cock but that's always been kind of an important imagery/feeling/concept to me. Thankfully, when I'm not looking at myself I never feel as if I have some kind of 'female' parts there.\r\nBut then, I had this dream, and I <ITALIC> did have a cock, and it WAS physically real, and I could hold it and everything...I'd gone shopping for and bought some kind of dick pump. It wasn't fitting properly, I just kept messing with it and it was visibly fairly empty compared to what it should've been. It was an opaque cylinder so you could see parts of it if you took it off to see. Then, this guy who was conveniently next to me (who I realized had no clue I was FTM, like I literally even passed IN the dream that much that he never even questioned it) was helping describe how to make it work best. So (maybe kind of NSFW, feel free to leave) it did manage to grip on properly, and literally I could see and feel it grow somehow the way I wanted it to all along after a couple more minutes of fiddling. And it was...huge. Like, appropriately- sized dick to what I've always wanted it to be and everything, I could hold it and feel it in my hand and that's all that I did with it, but it felt so right and so amazing.\r\n\r\nThe bittersweet part is I had a friend there. They are non-binary and one of my friends who truly understands my gender and accepts it maybe the most out of a lot of people, although I love and appreciate any of my friends who do. Well they saw me doing this and were probably even more shocked than I was. Like, impressed kind of shocked. And I wasn't trying to show off or anything. I just happened to be enjoying the moment at the time. It's bittersweet because not too long ago I was having feelings for them. I had to kind of squash all that cause they are dating and that took some time for me to get over and process, as silly as it may have been. I could actually picture us being together at different points which doesn't happen with just anyone. Without rambling too much more, the lesson I learned from that was a very positive one. My last few relationships that had ended, I largely thought were my fault for big mistakes I had made, or that they werent the right ones and I worried for a long time I'd never be 'good enough' to be with someone forever and I would probably mess it up in some way. Loving my friend opened my eyes to the fact that in a relationship, I actually have a lot to offer now in terms of being a good partner - caring for them, and doing anything for them, and making the odd sacrifice just to see them happy. \r\n\r\nI was cuddling with my friend afterwards in the dream (fully clothed) and also happened to be on top of them...anyway right after the highlight of that dream they were kissing me and told me they love me. I kissed them back, trying to enjoy it even knowing that I did care for them (maybe not full on love like I imagined it was) even knowing that's not real and that this part of the dream in specific was not real/genuine. They kept talking to me, just telling me some cute stories and stuff after that until I woke up...\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it was a very bittersweet dream. I had a few tears after that and I still feel like crying to be honest. It felt so right and knowing that I won't necessarily have a cock like that, of course it's at least a little upsetting and I wish I could've spent even longer in that moment of the dream, for as long as I wanted, even if it's not real. I've been going through a rough patch lately mental health wise in some ways and living in a house where my gender is not acknowledged either but this made me feel so good about myself and is something I will treasure for a long time.\r\n\r\nI think the stuff about my friend pretty clearly says how I felt about them or the things I saw possibly happening down the road - they could come around years from now but I wouldn't care to know that nor would I ever push it at this point either. I'd have a lot of work to do on myself before probably either of us could be together...but that's not the point. Clearly somewhere in my mind this dream has expressed some difficult feelings I was dealing with before that they'd like me more if I was a cis guy. I don't believe this was what the dream was about, and the person who I do end up with IRL will have to love all parts of me just like they will invetably love our intimacy and my cock in whatever shape it's in. That was merely a bittersweet part of the dream, and thankfully I am close enough with that friend that I felt comfortable sharing part of it with them. The part specifically of the experience of having a cock at least, haha. \r\n\r\nI hope anyone who hasn't had something like this can have it.

idkwhattoputhere000,"['Fuck, that is horrible I have no words.', 'The ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù age of consent being 18 is the biggest load of crap ever, more rules should be applied. \n It‚Äôs disgusting. Fuck ‚Äú18‚Äù being the age of consent with no other rules and exceptions applied to it. For these two reasons, imo;\n\nIn this world, where the sex work industry is preying on young women from all corners of her life, the age of consent being 18 is dangerous. Girls get socialised from young age that their sex appeal is their most important characteristic, and now, that sex work is empowering. They shove ‚Äúselling your body for money is empowering for women‚Äù down our throats all the time. They argue that having several ‚Äúclients‚Äù (men who the prostitutes/porn stars otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have sex with) a day, is empowering.\n\nMen don‚Äôt get socialised the same. To men is said ‚Äúbe a boss, be a leader‚Äù. They don‚Äôt have sexualisation flying at them from everywhere. Their beings aren‚Äôt sexualised the same way women‚Äôs are. No one is pushing young teenage boys into sex work and calling it empowering. No one is claiming sex work is empowering for men. Women are the ones suffering from this industry the most, from revenge porn to full on sex trafficking. \n\nI hate the fact that the minimum age to step into porn is 18. How many girls who just turned 18 actually join it. Porn. Onlyfans. What else? And these individuals who support sex work actually call it ‚Äúher own empowering choice‚Äù! Choice? Choice?! A choice, or a result of a rotten society where women are hypersexualised and objectified all the time? A choice, or a country with an effed up economical system where lower class women don‚Äôt get enough financial/social aid and are therefore more likely to resort to selling their body? 18. Young. Naive. Impressionable. Maybe certain mental issues, maybe daddy issues due to an absent father. She hears ‚Äúsex work makes you a boss b<ITALIC> **!!!‚Äù , and being young and stupid as we all are somehow when we are 18, she joins the sex work industry. Something that will likely haunt her forever. Something that is dangerous for her body, and her mental health. 18 year olds are allowed to join it, why aren‚Äôt libfems & sex work supporters criticising that? That should be a crime. A humans brain develops until age 25, I would like to see the sex work and porn industry abolished entirely, but if those exploitive capitalist pornpigs calling their pornsites ‚Äúwholesome‚Äù actually want to make it seem more ethical, make the minimum age to join porn 25, and make anything younger than that a crime. Not for the girl, she is the victim. For the Johns exploiting her. Let‚Äôs see how many women after 25 who aren‚Äôt as naive anymore due to maturity will join.\nThis industry preys on young naive teenage girls. Vultures. It makes me mad.\n\nAnother reason I hate the general age of consent being 18 with no other rules added, is that an 18 year old woman can have sex with a 45 year old man and it‚Äôs legal. Wtf? Why should that be legal in a just world? That is a structure based on power imbalance. The girl probably has daddy issues and is impressionable if she goes with a man that old, it‚Äôs unfair, it should be a crime (for the man). There should be some sort of age limit as to how old the man is allowed to be to have sex with a woman that young.', 'Just because something is mainstream doesn‚Äôt mean it shouldn‚Äôt be criticised.

Woloa,"['The Sandy Tomb \n I\'ve been a bit hesitant to share this one as I usually like to be the hero in these stories but no one was entirely in the right here. This was a campaign run by Steve the Cleric from one of my <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>. The setup was pretty good, a call for heroes came out from a major port city on the edge of a desert country (don\'t question it) as an ancient tomb at the city\'s center suddenly became unlocked. The place is filled with undead, seems to reset every night and no one who\'s gone in has come out. Our job was to get in and make it stop being unlocked before the undead decide to leave. For the record, we were using a slightly looser 3.5 ruleset.\r\n\r\nSorry if this whole thing is a bit disjointed, I am a man with bad memory working off memories of a game from 5-7 years ago that wasn\'t much fun.\r\n\r\nEnter the player characters:  \r\nMy first ever joke character and second TTRPG character ever, Gnomish Tuba Bard Katzmcgee Waffletoff, later replaced by raciest High Elf Sorcerer Ezekial Ravadera\r\n\r\nMy stepdad\'s worst character ever, the elf... something, Carzan\r\n\r\nA halfling druid and human cleric who\'s names I have forgotten because they aren\'t important\r\n\r\nand The Guide, human ranger/sorcerer and the only genuinely fun character to come out of this story.\r\n\r\nSo, the party get together and head into the tomb, all of the doors are double wide and open by swivling at the middle, creating two smaller doorways. A couple of rooms in, Katz finds a basket of undead bees, they attack him, of course, and Carzan just shuts and spikes the door, leaving him to die. Somehow, he didn\'t die but I was still mad about it. When Katz asked Carzan why he did that Carzan replied ""I\'m an elf you know"". This quickly became Carzan\'s catchphrase. It was bad.\r\n\r\nOur first expidition into the tomb ended with the party finding a pair of urchins who had somehow survived inside overnight and trying to convince them to go with us, Katz was an incompetent bard and could not inspire courage, my realization of this is what led to him being replaced after the first session with my own elf, who was the worst. Also, Carzan kidnapped one of the kids and forced him to basicly be his boyservant.\r\n\r\nEnter Ezekial Ravadera (henceforth known as Zeke) who\'s first act as a player character was to watch his own mother be stabbed and then disperce the guards she\'d brought along to find the culprit, loot her corpse and then leave, never to care again. He was the edgiest character I\'ve ever played by far. Zeke was specialized in social manipulation magic because I thought it would be interesting, low and behold, every enemy was either undead or elemental for the entire campaign and every one of the very few NPCs he interacted with had an exceptional bonus to will saves and the ability to detect spells being cast on them at any range. Additionally, after an incident where he drank a tiny water elemental like a fucking idiot, Zeke became the exclusive target of every single elemental we came across the rest of the campaign, they were DEDICATED to killing him and only him. We never found out why.\r\n\r\nThe human cleric was soon replaced by a dwarf cleric for reasons I have forgotten, his introduction to the party happened around the same time as Zeke\'s, which is to say: moments before a guard made a passive agressive remark towards Carzan, prompting the elf to kill the guard, which attracted more guards, so Carzan sat down and called for guards. Zeke and the dwarf slinked away together even though they were both raciest against eachother, prefering to be with eachother rather than near Carzan.\r\n\r\nOnce Carzan, The Guide and our druid were done dispatching like 10 guards they retrieved the rest of us and we elected to return to the tomb as a group. For reasons I forget Zeke had a yellow rose tatoo on the back of his hand that glowed on contact with things he already knew were magical and I thought this was a cool trait. In my defense, I was like 14 at the time. After this ground breaking revelation, the new dwarf suggested using his pickaxe to make some temporary shortcuts for us, only to find that EVERY wall and door of the entire tomb had an inner layer of some kind of indestructable, non-magical, heat proof metal that was entirely structurally stable in spite of being paper thin. \r\n\r\nThat was really the last event that occured before the campaign just kinda stopped, because everyone had a bad taste in their mouths and the only character liked by anyone other than their player was The Guide.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: Everyone was bad, I was among the worst and the campaign fizzled out.', ""Strange repositioning issue \n So, replaying the whole series recently, I found that I can't reposition units before a battle starts in the second game, but this problem only applies to Rook's crew, I can reposition members of the ravens just fine.

Look at the traditional diets/kitchens of your ancestors to find out what amount and products you are likley to tolerate in your diet.

It was almost the only thing their ancestors had to eat during the winters, so they are adapted for a dairy heavy diet. Europeans generally handle dairy well, but some people only tolerate certain amounts, and fermented products like yoghurt are a lot easier on digestion than ¬´normal¬ª unfermented milk. In the middle east and India, fermented products are common, but drinking a glass of milk is not too common (harder on digestion and spills quickly in heat). In southeast Asia, dairy products have traditionally not been a big part of the diet. Sub saharan Africa is HUGE and there are big local variations depending on whether farming cattle has traditionally been common or not. \n\nThis map gives some indication on local variations today, but it may still tell us something about how common dairy was traditionally:\n<LINK>', 'I wish I looked that cool at that age.']",F

brokenlampPMW2,"['(SPOILERS) Hell\'s Kitchen Power Rankings - Episode 9 (Dec 14) \n Hello again, everyone. I hope you had a fantastic week and are preparing for a wonderful holiday season. It was a rather predictable episode this time \'round, with one major exception. Rankings are starting to get much tougher because there\'s no longer any contestants I would classify as consistently poor performers. Without any further sentences, let\'s do this. Note - there\'s no ""last time"" rank beside the name this time, because there were no rankings last week.\n\n<ITALIC> What this is: If you didn‚Äôt catch these earlier in the season, these are my power rankings after each episode. It‚Äôs essentially who I believe to be the strongest down to the weakest. These do not necessarily reflect who I think is going home next, and aren\'t scientific or insider-y. Without further ado, let\'s get going! (Spoilers for the entirety of the most recent episode, obviously)\n\n\n\n\n<BOLD> 1 - Ariel\n\nThe longer this series has gone on, the more Ariel has impressed in nearly every way. She\'s a strong leader, a consistently good performer in both challenges and service, and seems to be fairly popular in the ""personality contest.""\n\n<BOLD> 2 - Motto\n\nConsistently underrated to this point, Motto has been very consistent to the point where I can easily see him going to the final two or three. <STRIKE> He\'s also younger and seems to learn well, which is always a plus.\n\nEDIT: He\'s not as young as I thought, but he still shows a great will to learn. \n\n<BOLD> 3 - Mia\n\nThere have been recent slips in consistency lately, and the leadership side of things hasn\'t been going as easily as it seemed it would have earlier in the season. Still though, a strong candidate for black jackets.\n\n<BOLD> 4 - Jose\n\nHe almost got sent home, but I think the potential he\'s shown so far made him easily the safest bet of the three to stick around.\n\n<BOLD> 5 - Bret\n\nHe\'s gotten more consistent as time\'s gone on, but he\'ll just have to have a few more shining moments to really take him further. I think black jackets are very possible though. Also, the punishment pass reference by the editors was superb.\n\n<BOLD> 6 - Kanae\n\nKanae is still a big personality that clearly has a ton of talent, but she\'s yet to have the overwhelmingly positive nights like Mia or Motto have had, or the subtle compliments that Jose has seen.\n\n<BOLD> 7 - Heather\n\nHeather\'s been much more consistent lately than around the start of the show, but she\'s still had those shaky moments, which is very dangerous when veterans are on a shorter leash.\n\n<BOLD> 8 -  Trev\n\nIf Trev makes black jackets, I\'ll be very impressed. That said, his team\'s patience for his personality seems to be wearing thin. I can see him going further than it seems though.\n\n<BOLD> E - Scotley\n\nI\'ve spoken about Scotley\'s bullying enough in previous lists, so I\'ll keep it short here. I think it was the right call to send him home.\n\n\n\n\nAs always, if you disagree/agree with me, please let me know below. Enjoy the upcoming holiday season!', 'If you‚Äôre surprised by this, you weren‚Äôt paying attention.

This puts waste management workers at risk of injury. Do not throw your empty small breakable glass vials of testosterone in the garbage.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, testosterone can be absorbed through the skin if you come in contact with it. It is also an environmental pollutant that can affect wildlife. Do not put it in a landfill where it can get into the soil/groundwater. Putting it in your sharps container where it can be safely incinerated with other medical waste is appropriate.\r\n\r\nYou can also use alternate containers than sharps containers if you have no other option and are looking for a way to safely get rid of your used sharps. Look for a bottle made of thick plastic that cannot be punctured by needles. I would recommend laundry detergent bottles because they are large, easy to find, and very sturdy.

Demo otherwise has been great aside from stuttering the longer I play it in typical PC port fashion; driving is solid, visuals are outstanding as usual, cars seem to sound better than FH3, and I love love <ITALIC> love the roads.\n\nHowever, some screenshots I captured in the garage really worry me. <LINK> Here, I show the rarity details listed on two of the cars in the garage and on the horns, with the McLaren labeled ""legendary"" with an orange rarity and the Lancia labeled ""epic"" with a purple rarity. What I didn\'t picture are the blue cars all being labeled with a ""rare"" rarity. I just don\'t see why cars would be labeled with the same rarity system as horns and various cosmetics other than lootboxes, considering gaming trends. It could possibly be a change to wheelspins (which were already shit and stupid to begin with) but I feel like a rarity system in wheelspins is so out of left field, and nothing anybody asked for, or at least not any time I\'ve seen, that it wouldn\'t make sense to spend time implementing when they\'re already having to delay features like the route creator to finish them. (source <LINK>/)\n\nIf cars are packaged in purchasable lootboxes with real currency then I honestly am thoroughly impressed by the cynicism of Microsoft and their subsidiaries. How could you make a game in your beautiful home country as this wonderful passion project and have the gall to spit on your consumers as you do it? This is, of course, in addition to other contemptuous practices like day 1 pre-order DLC and car passes that, assuming they follow the same standards. don\'t include all cars, and also a season pass.\n\nDepending on how lootboxes are implemented into this game, I might not find it absolutely gross. I mean, I think implementing gambling to exploit people that lack self control is gross too, but if it ends up being unobtrusive and only affects shit like horns and player cosmetics then it\'s pathetic but I can get by, especially with the route creator supposedly being so robust. But if this game harps at me constantly like most Microsoft-published games do about their DLC and microtransactions then I\'d be happy to refund a purchase and do something else. It\'d be a pretty bold move on Playground\'s part as well considering the potential for a very difficult market in their home in the EU following Belgium and the Netherland\'s legislation on this form of gambling in games.\n\nWe\'ll see what happens. Maybe Playground will have something to say about this, but I\'m not thrilled about this stuff. Considering Turn 10 has been nothing but stiff and dismissive with criticism and concern over FM7, its launch, optimization, and its monetization, I\'m concerned to see how that attitude may stem to their child studio.

Patchirisu,"['Been loving my new flowery smelly body wash!', 'Me after I call someone ""she"" but then he corrects me:', 'I\'m definitely not a standard type of plural. \n I don\'t consider myself a plural at all. Or a ""system"" or a, what was it... ""member""? But the about section said this was for all forms of multiple people in one head, which I guess this counts as, so I\'ll share anyway. I only just found out about this sub, and it seems a tad strange to me, to be honest, but if this is the situation you\'re in, I won\'t judge. \n\nI love bullshit meta writing. Characters aware that they\'re characters, stories interacting with the reader, pushing the boundaries between the reader and an observer, self referential writing, omnipotent self inserts, you name it. I read homestuck, it was confusing as hell, I ate that shit up and begged for more. I wrote my own. I wrote a dialogue for school. Two characters speaking, the thoughtful one and the optimistic one, both aware of the fragile and dubious state of their existence, or perhaps nonexistence. They spoke to eachother, developed for a while, interacted with metatextual concepts. After a while, the thoughtful one switched the document to single spacing to conserve space. They abandoned their quotation marks when they spoke, and at one point, I let the thoughtful one write a section of the narrative. But they weren\'t really seperate people. All the thoughtful one is is me pretending to be her. A character like any other. I consider what she\'d do and I type it out as if I were her. Right before she wrote the part of the story, she told me ""Of course, you\'ll still be writing it, like you\'ve written everything I\'ve done, but you\'ll be writing it as if you were me. Entirely me, like you\'re writing right now, as I say this, as opposed to you being you, and me being a part of you.""\n\nSo that\'s what they are. Segments of my consciousness I can pull up to figure out what I think they\'d say. I\'m not sure I\'m right though. I might not be writing them well and consistently. So, some time passes, I make a writing portfolio for class, and I put the dialogue in it. In the reflection portion of the portfolio, I let them out and do some self analysis through them. Come next year, I\'m writing my college essay. Not one I\'ll actually be submitting to colleges, I just had to write one for English class. I write it with them, having a conversation throughout. I realize I haven\'t been treating them properly. I gave them self awareness, and even though they\'re less complex, less sentient than I am, I should still let them out. So I wrote them an ending. I placed them in a fictional instance of Earth. The thoughtful one chose the name Callie, and the Optimistic one chose the name Eliza. Or really, I chose for them. Because that\'s the only thing I can do. Callie becomes an author, and she does <ITALIC> not write metafiction because she knows better than anyone that\'s a whole can of worms. We still talk. I can write a conversation with them any time I want. On their end, It\'s written as the phone in their house ringing, and I\'m on the other end. In the final draft of my essay, I did something absolutely bullshit. I shared the essay with them. The one that they\'re in. It was weird, and confusing, and it just wouldn\'t work. Callie told me this couldn\'t be my college essay. It\'s too bullshit, too confusing. I told her I thought I could fix it. That this was me. This was what I was like. It finished off with: \n\n‚ÄúPatch, this is really important, college is going to affect your entire life. Just once, can you suck it up and just write something normal about the time your pet died or something?‚Äù\n\nI can‚Äôt\n\nSo that\'s basically the whole thing. I guess AMA? You can also ask Callie and Eliza anything I guess, too. I\'ll try to answer as well as I can. Hey, are you two ok with that?\n\nE: ""Yeah, alright. I guess we\'re in a unique situation. Shoot.""\n\nNice. Callie, you?\n\nC: ""Yeah. I think this is all unnecessary and you\'re overplaying this with people with no real relation to this, but sure. Whatever.""\n\nWere you always this cynical?\n\nC: ""I don\'t think I was, really. I was very emotionally supportive. That\'s just kind of what you\'ve boiled my personality down to. You\'ve been doing me pretty wrong. I guess there\'s one thing you got right, even in the ending. I love Eliza.""\n\nFuck, I have, haven\'t I? Oh, shit I\'m so sorry.\n\nC: ""doesn\'t matter. I\'m not real, remember?""\n\nBut you a... yeah. I guess you\'re right. By which I mean I\'m right, of course. Even when I\'m wrong I can\'t bear to let myself not be right.\n\n==========================================\n\nEdit: They\'re not the only ones either. But most of the others are more ""short lived"". And they\'re usually versions of me, quick dips into a hypothetical world. For example, for a long time now, my Nintendo 3ds has been suffering touch screen issues because if sand that got inside it. I\'ve been asking my dad if we could try taking it apart to clean it out for a while. Recently, I\'d had enough and asked him if we could please open it up and fix it now. He said ok, and we took it apart, put it back together, and it wouldn\'t turn on. I was pretty upset, but my parents ended up giving me a new one that they already had because they were saving it for Christmas because they knew I\'d been having touch screen troubles. But, if I couldn\'t turn my old one on, I couldn\'t transfer my data. I\'d basically have to start over on all downloadable games. So we were all feeling a lot of regret. Me, for being so desperate to do something so stupid and reckless, and them for not just giving it to me when I asked to fix my old one and being able to transfer my data. So, I thought, ""If I had just asked them, this whole thing would have been avoided."" So I placed myself in a hypothetical situation, in my mind:\n\n\nI walked into my parents room. ""Hey, I\'ve really been having problems with my 3ds,"" I said. ""Can we handle that?""\n""Uh, yeah."" My dad said. ""I\'ll get the tools.""\n""Hey, uh, you know, this might actually make it worse. If we end up breaking it, I might lose my data permanently. Can you just give me the one you\'re saving for Christmas now to avoid a whole mess?""\n""How did you know about that?"" My mom asked. <ITALIC> Fuck. How did <ITALIC> I know about that? Well, they showed me. Right after I broke my- ""Oh goddamnit I put myself in a hypothetical situation again, didn\'t I? I\'m sorry, mom and dad, but none of this is real. I\'m just, or rather my external self, who already broke his, is thinking about what might have happened if I just asked for the new one now."" ""What? Come on, that\'s rediculous."" They said. ""Yeah, I\'m so sorry, but now that I\'ve realized this, our universe is about to break down and we\'re all going to stop existing.""\n\nOutside, I thought, ""oh my God, this is getting too meta. I gotta stop."" I made myself stop thinking about it. \n\nAnd this happens <ITALIC> all the time I\'m constantly making other versions of myself, and then they become aware of their confinement and the metanarrative structure breaks down. I\'m like Dirk fucking Strider with all these splinters. I\'ve constantly got little brain ghosts running around in my head.\n\nRecently, while questioning if I was trans, but still undecided, I wrote a conversation between myself and my impression of what a potential, future, trans version of myself might be like. She had self awareness, she knew she was just my guess at a hypothetical future. After she told me her story, which I made up, and we finished our conversation, I asked her if she wanted to go live with Callie and Eliza now that she has self awareness. She turned me down. The way I think, the way I keep making versions of myself, they\'re used to not being the real me, and then fading away back into my greater self. Here\'s the dialogue, I guess. \n\n""No, I think I\'m gonna stay here.""\n\nWhat do you mean? Where even is ""here""?\n\n""In the future, I guess. It\'s hardly the first time you\'ve thought like this. You\'ll always have potential future selves, you\'ve even wondered before what they\'d say to you if you could talk to them. I\'ll be ok.""\n\nHeh, alright. See ya around.\xa0\n\nI guess she\'s still with me. Every time I look ahead. But, the future she told me about has already proven to be slightly untrue. Does that mean she\'s dead, and other, future selves are all different people?\n\nI even tried writing porn for the first time recently. I thought it was good, but apparently I can\'t even resist making my porn meta.', ""Put your real gender, and if you haven't figured that out yet, put questioning or something like that.""]",F

Around half of all binary trans people (very little difference depending on gender) experience childhood sexual assault; statistics on cisgender people vary hugely depending on how the question is asked, but between 2%-18% of cis boys<ITALIC>  and 10-20% of cis girls are victims. Trans women are way way* more likely to be victims of childhood sexual assault than cis women. \r\n\r\n*If you ask boys if they‚Äôre victims of pedophilia specifically, you get a very low rate. If you ask boys if their first sexual experience was when they were below the age of consent and involved an older individual, you get a very high rate.

Backrow removal to pre-emptively protect your monsters from S/Ts such as Cosmic Cyclone and Night Beam usually comes to mind.\r\n\r\nLance also helps weaken enemy monsters as Crystrons tend to lack in raw power (strongest monster is Quariongandrax at 3000). This purpose doesn't take as much priority as S/T protection does as Crystrons usually take things out with effects rather than battle anyway, and World Legacy Clash (which I assume you have) does the job well.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you can get Forbidden Lance, I recommend it."", ""That's typically my answer, but in the context of Crystal Crystrons, your only Tribute Summonable monster is Sulfefnir, who is usually the one you try to get in the GY as soon as possible.

You'd need to immediately go into a high level Synchro during <ITALIC> your turn just to get rid of it, assuming it doesn't get flipped by another Floodgate or Canadia right after.\r\n\r\nThat's also part of the reason why I think a second Lancea is a good idea; in addition to preventing Invocation from using my monsters and banishing Aleister for the recycle, I also have a back-up Tribute Summon that can thankfully tribute itself next turn. <DESCRIPTION> <LINK>.

The pro-style FX loadout, relatively large tempo faders, and included Rekordbox Pro license make it an absolute powerhouse for mixing. \r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  (Relatively) large tempo faders for easy beatmatching\r\n Nexus-style FX layout eases the transition to CDJs\r\n* Full Rekordbox DJ license\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  Smaller jog wheels than other options\r\n Almost uncomfortably small form factor\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Pioneer DDJ-SB3 ($237)\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK> \r\n\r\nThe SB3 is the maternal twin brother to the DDJ 400. They are almost the same price, offer roughly the same features and were released at a similar time. The SB3 boasts full controller-sized jog wheels, classic controller FX, and a Serato Lite license.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  5.5-inch jog wheels\r\n Virtual 4-deck capability\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  Small pitchfaders\r\n No full software license\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Native Instruments S2 Mk3 ($330)\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\nThe S2 Mk3 has perhaps the best jogs out of any intro-level controller. They lack the light, plastic feel of other options, giving a feeling of inertia and a metal build. The controller comes with Traktor which has been a viable, although (in my opinion) strangely laid out software for a long time. The pitchfaders are also very nicely sized, matching roughly to the length of a DDJ-400\'s. The controller also has a nice build to it, feeling quite premium for a 2-deck. The lack of a dedicated Beat FX section may be problematic for more experienced DJs, though. The controller also supports STEM files as all Traktor controllers do, which allow independently toggleable and filterable drum, bass, lead, and vocal layers.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  Fantastic, tactile jog wheels\r\n Large pitchfaders\r\n<ITALIC>  Good build quality\r\n STEM ready\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  No Beat FX (although Mixer FX do have tempo-related features occasionally)\r\n Higher price point (hardly a con as you receive better build quality in exchange)\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Numark Mixtrack 3 ($149)\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\nThe Numark Mixtrack is something of a middleman between the ultra-budget range of controllers and the entry level. It is the lowest-priced controller that I would be willing to recommend as a learning tool. It does have pads, a cue button, beat FX, and all the basic features of a controller, however.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  Very low price point\r\n Long pitch faders\r\n* Touch Strip\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  Only 4 pads per deck\r\n Flimsy build quality\r\n* Bad sound (even by entry level standards)\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Roland DJ-202 ($290)\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\nThe Roland DJ 202 is somewhat identical to controllers such as the DDJ RB or SB3 on first glance. However, on closer inspection it possesses better jogs and more advanced volume control (cue mix and sampler knobs) than the Pioneer options at a slightly increased price. \r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  Light but tactile and responsive jogs\r\n Advanced volume control \r\n* Virtual 4-deck\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  Laggy pads\r\n Small pitchfaders\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n<BOLD> MID-RANGE\r\n\r\nThe mid range is where choice matters the most. No two controllers perform alike here due to a hugely varying price range. Most DJs don\'t start with mid-range gear and often upgrade to it. \r\n\r\n(Tie for <HEADING> 1) <BOLD> Pioneer DDJ SR2 ($700)\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\nThe DDJ SR2 is a conceived upgrade to the SB3. It has a touch strip for shuttling between tracks, LED jogwheel indicators, a heavier build, larger faders, and better sound. It is capable of similar performance of high-end controllers minus four-channel capability.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  Good sound quality\r\n Touch strip\r\n* Cost-efficient\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  No color FX (filter only)\r\n Primitive jog indicator can be hard to use for precise scratching and juggling\r\n\r\n(Tie for <HEADING> 1) <BOLD> Pioneer DDJ 800 ($800)\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\nThe DDJ 800 was concived alongside the 400 as an upgraded version, however it ends up outperforming it\'s sister controller, the SR2. Several things cause this, namely multiple color FX (the SB2 only has a filter,) internalized beat FX (meaning all the FX are built into the soundcard as opposed to running on the computer,) full-size tempo faders, and a jog wheel display (as opposed to the LED ring on the SR2). \r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  Nexus-style FX and loop controls\r\n Hi-res jog display\r\n* Complete Pioneer standard FX\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  Expensive\r\n No touch strip\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Traktor S3 ($650)\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\nThe Traktor S3 was added into the Traktor Kontrol S lineup somewhat recently. It is essentially a 4-channel S2, serving as a midway between that and the pro-level S4. It features 4 channels, a unique feature for this price point. It\'s jog wheels, identical to the S2\'s, do not serve as a perk now as other controllers at this range have wheels of similar quality. A major downside to this controller is the lack of a beat FX unit, which was understandable for the S2 but a serious flaw at this range. It does play a trick by only taking one external input, as well. The controller also supports STEM files.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  4 channel mixer with 1 external input\r\n Dedicated loop and beat jump knobs\r\n<ITALIC>  STEM ready\r\n Low price\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  No beat FX\r\n Not a full 4-channel mixer\r\n* Rubber play/cue buttons\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Roland DJ-505 ($600)\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\nThe DJ-505 is a very unique controller. In addition to possessing a somewhat standard feature layout at this range (2 channels, metal jogs, outer-ring jog LEDs, full-sized up and cross faders,) the 505 has one very intresting feature that screams Roland: a built in drum machine. The DJ 505 condenses the controls of a TR-8 drum machine (Roland\'s infamous drum synth) into a sequencer strip, 606/707/808/909 selector, level knob, and BPM counter. The rest of the controller holds up to standards, not really offering anything unique but not carrying any major flaws either.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n* Internalized drum machine\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n* Small tempo faders\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n<BOLD> PRO-LEVEL\r\n\r\nCompetition here is tight. DJs expect the functionality of a Nexus CDJ setup for as low a price as possible. Thus, only a few controllers made the cut. \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n<BOLD> (<HEADING> 1 choice) Pioneer DDJ-1000 ($1100)\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\nThe DDJ 1000 is the One Controller to Rule Them All. It takes ""nexus functionality"" quite literally and actually plops the 7 inch (every other controller on this list besides the DDJ 400 has 5.5 inch) jog of their beloved CDJ 2000 line down into this controller. This includes the hi-res display in the center. It also features the same FX as the DJM-900 mixer.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  7-inch, tension-adjustable, ultra-responsive jog-wheels\r\n Full-sized tempo faders\r\n<ITALIC>  Nexus-style FX\r\n Jog displays\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n* None\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Traktor S4 Mk3 ($1000)\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\nThe S4 Mk3 is the pinnacle of motorized jog technology. It\'s jogs not only rotate with an impressive torque and use a slipmat simulation that uses variable tension to simulate the effect of touching a record, they are also haptic, meaning you feel a \\*click\\* as you scratch over hot cues. This is infinitely useful for scratching as it allows you to feel your beat juggles and cuts in addition to hearing them. The controller also offers standalone mixer capability, dedicated loop and jump wheels, onboard displays that show waveforms and samples, and a sleek, ergonomic design outdoing the no-frills, almost messy Pioneer designs. The controller also supports STEM files as all Traktor controllers do. A downside to all Traktor controllers that becomes more apparent at this range, however, is the lack of multiple pad modes. There is no roll or slicer and the use of samples requires a dedicated track. There is also no mic channel.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  Fantastic motorized jogs\r\n Dedicated loop and jump knobs\r\n<ITALIC>  Hi-res waveform display\r\n STEM-ready\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  Limited pad modes\r\n No dedicated mic channel\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Roland DJ-808 ($1300)\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\nThe Roland DJ-808 combines the drum machine of the 505 with a full-fledged 4-channel controller. The drum machine allows whole new levels of creativity and fun, now with more control over the sound of the sample (ASDR, individual sample, pitch, etc.) The controller part features sub-standardly sized jogs that are still highly responsive with dual indicators (on and around the wheel.) The controller includes four sound color modes, Serato-style FX, independent mic control, and full-sized tempo faders.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n<ITALIC>  Internal drum machine with enhanced sample control\r\n Complete features in addition to drum machine\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n* Small jogs\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Honorable mentions:\r\n\r\n<BOLD> DDJ-RZ\r\n\r\n(no link)\r\n\r\nThis controller has been discontinued with the launch of the DDJ 1000. However, it still offers more features than any other controller on the market with touch strips, a large form factor, and a built in filter/pitch variable oscillator for generating sweeps. It was very expensive, however, and will still run more than a new DDJ-1000 used.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> DDJ-SX3\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\nThis controller, although currently being manufactured, is virtually useless. It was designed as an upgrade to the SR-2 and has features comparable to the 1000. However, it costs more, has less capable FX, no jog displays, and smaller jog wheels. \r\n\r\n<BOLD> DDJ-RB\r\n\r\n(no link)\r\n\r\nAnother discontinued controller, the RB was almost identical to the SB3 despite being for Rekordbox. It only had one fx slot per deck, however. It is still a very solid controller and can be found used but did not make the list due to being discontinued.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Denon MC series\r\n\r\nThe Denon controllers have always been wacky. They didn\'t really offer anything unique and have confusing layouts and less features than other comparable controllers. The MC4000 entry-level, for example, only has 4 pads and uses a strange radial layout as opposed to the left-to-right of many controller deck sections, despite costing significantly more than any other entry controller. The only unit I considered would be the MC8000, but that is a standalone unit which is thus not a controller. All-in-one standalones are a different thing and come with a whole different set of issues to compare.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> DDJ 200\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\nThe DDJ 200 ""smart controller"" is a wireless IPad controller designed to be ultra-lightweight and small. It runs for around the price of a Numark mixtrack, a full-fledged controller, and for this reason, I cannot recommend it. I/O lag, lack of onboard features, and tiny size make this unit unfit for learning properly on and not worth the price tag.\r\n\r\n<BOLD> Numark Party Mix\r\n\r\n<DESCRIPTION> <LINK>\r\n\r\nThe Numark Party Mix is the best ultra-entry controller on the market, seriously outperforming smart and micro controllers. I did not include this in the main list becasue it would be out of place (being nearly a third of the price of most entry level controllers,) but it is fine to learn on despite being very very very basic. It covers what it needs to for the basics and if it is all someone has then that\'s fine. I would reccomend saving if possible to upgrade to a Mixtrack, however, which has similar features but a much larger form factor (the Party Mix is uncomfortably small.)\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I hope this helped. This is a very common question and I want to provide as much info as possible on the subject. I wrote a similar post a while ago, but there were some things the community suggested I change. I hope to have the cooperation of the mods in sidebaring this post to help prevent redundant questions.', ""I'm so proud of you sister! You overcame such a hard struggle and pulled through!

I'm looking for clarity. \n So much of my identity has always been a reaction to how others see me, how they themselves react to me. I guess that's kinda what gender is, really, a set of conventions that others expect from you in presentation. Maybe that's why in 25 years I never realized I might be trans. This past year it's clouded my thoughts and unleashed storms that I've solemnly waited out until just recently I let it all wash over me and it felt so wonderful, so clarifying. What a grand affirming gesture it was to come out to myself! Then I came out to people I care about. I have the luxury at my age of having people I care about but don't owe anything. I've never felt close to genetic family because of this sense of obligation. My chosen family responded pretty well, though it's obviously been pretty difficult for my girlfriend, which has made it more difficult for me. I'm 6 months into the best relationship of my life and happier than I've ever been. And I've always considered myself a very happy person; I put the happiness of myself and others above everything else, in this short-sighted sort of way that has led me to never plan for my future and waste all my supposed talent and potential in college. What a luxury it is to be happy. I wonder why I think that. I think that's something we're all made to internalize, and that makes the process of transitioning even harder as we feel like what we're doing is superfluous. But I've rejected this thinking. Being happy is the most basic human right. I deserve it. Everyone deserves it. Fuck I don't know what I'm doing. Why am I even writing this? My stream of thought bounces around at such a pace with such dime-drop pivot speed, I wonder how I ever get anything done. Sometimes it really seems like I've never gotten anything done. So how the fuck am I supposed to turn myself from a soft but subtly manly boy into a beautiful woman? I usually don't have dysphoria. It almost feels like wanting to be a woman has led me to appreciate the manly elements I'd always thought I'd lacked. But I fucking hate them when I try to present femme. I'm vapid like that. I'm shallow. I wanna wake up looking like a porn star. I regret that so much of my gender questioning origins are tied into porn. What I crave is validation, the sense of truth that comes with a concensus reaction of belonging. What deeper validation is there than lust? What greater height of desire? I know, I know, there's so much more to being a woman. I want to discover that. But it's dizzying and unknown, so of course I return to something familiar. Perhaps each trans person's experience is inherently tied to and based around whatever we find most strongly appealing about our true gender. That's part of what makes NBs so cool. They're pioneers of a new gender horizon. I think I'm a bold and unique person in many ways and often wonder if I am my own sort of non-binary. But sometimes being a whole-ass goddamn woman just has such strong appeal to me. It's just so difficult to understand what I want without being able to visualize it, and it's tough to be able to visualize it without being able to present it, but it's tough to be able to present it when I don't know exactly what it is that I want. Thoughts like these circle around and form the vortex which sucks me into uncertainty again. And I'm back at the start, alone in my thoughts, with no progress made. I wish that I could just think it out, just focus and deliberate alone until I understand what I am and what I want. But so much of my identity has always been a reaction to how others see me.""]",F

Cardiac \n\nThe vagina is made up of skeletal muscle tissue because the vagina is not the heart or a structure controlled involuntarily. (Like veins or your stomach) \n\nThe vagina is like other skeletal muscles that are controlled voluntarily (abs, biceps). Muscles grow and strengthen with use. And atrophy if not used. So like lifting weights, sex actually increases the muscle tone of the vagina. The more someone works out their vagina through prolonged and rhythmic muscle contractions during sex and orgasm; the tighter a vagina will contract around a penis. \n\nSome men claim through anecdotal evidence that they have felt a different in tightness between a Virgin and a woman who has had sex. No scientific evidence supports these claims. Although these stories are easily explained by anxiety that a Virgin may feel during their first experience. Nerves cause a woman to tense up (flexing that vagina muscle) and will not be as naturally lubricated.  A woman who is not nervous and is ready for sex will be wet, less friction, and initially has a relaxed vagina allowing for easier entrance. \n\nI hope this explains why exactly your statement is fundamentally incorrect when considering human biology', 'That‚Äôs how everyone else learns, just some people learn faster than others lol', 'Also I don‚Äôt get why they lie?

It regards child abuse. \n This is gonna be a long post. But please bear with me. I need help. So I recently had a friend come to me for advise, and well I am a little distraught and upset. I myself and frustrated and at a loss because my friend is kind of a idiot, and is pretty oblivious.  He  seems to think that family could never abuse a child. The reason he came to me is because I personally was abused and that includes sexual abuse. So he figures I know what to do. The guy claims his brother is a good man and would never hurt his own child. That the mother of the child claims he sexually abused the little girl. But that she is a liar. (I will not name anyone for protective reasons.) Now he is on the side of his brother claiming the mother is crazy and a bad person. He claims she brings the child over and she is dirty and starving. That she is not well cared for by the mother.But I personally do not know her. I have however met his brother who is one of those nice guy nerdy types who hates woman and tried to say they are all bitches and cunts. He even says I am a bitch and calls me homophobic slurs. Excuse my language. I am just copying what others say. I am gender fluid, and lgbt. So personally for me I hate any kind of discrimination and hate speech.  I know what it is like to be discriminated against. I do not tolerate it well. However I do not want to be biased and say the mother is telling the truth. The problem is the child is a mute, acts out, and pisses herself. Now I have personally experienced abuse. So this child is me as a child. Only she is not disabled. Adults just assumed I was stupid and well Retarded. (Sorry if that offends anyone. But I do have cerebral palsy, and Fetal alcohol syndrome. Back in the 90‚Äôs parents said shit like that.So did other asshole kids.)That is pretty much what they said about me growing up. But this child has no known disabilities. Shows classic signs of being sexually abused. So I just feel very conflicted. I am a parent myself and if that was my child I would be freaking the F out and yeah I would be trying to figure out who messed with my child. Children do not just stop talking and act out for no reason. I might have been disabled and yeah I had trouble socializing. But I did not piss myself because I was stupid, and I certainly was not mute at school because I was stupid. I just was afraid that anything I said was gonna be called a lie or that I was gonna be called retarded or stupid. Now I can not shut up lol! I also did a lot of really stupid shit for attention because I was being neglected at home and mentally abused as well. So I sat in my room crying for a while, and I still do not know what to say to him. When I told my family that my aunt put her hand up my shirt half of them refused to believe me. Because she called me delusional and crazy. And she says I am mentally ill. I am depressed and have anxiety. Not a lot of people have seen her while she was not sober: and she denies everything. So of course people are gonna believe her. My birth dad and my uncle however know she slept with her sister in law while drunk. So at least they are on my side. But I know how hard it is to believe someone you love and care about would do something sick and disgusting. I did not even want to believe she was a bad person. So when she claimed her ex husband abused her I believed her despite her drinking and hearing her try to seduce him all the time while drunk. (Btw she raised me, and called me her daughter). She was very manipulative and until she told me I took pictures of the bruises I did believe her. But have no recollection of that, and have no pictures of the bruises: But that‚Äôs besides the point. The point is. I told him to go to cps, and to get that child into counseling. But bedsides that I have no idea what else to say to him. I know he wants to defend his brother. And for me I personally do not know if he should. I remember being 6 or 7. I was left with a baby sitter. People trusted him. Good Christian boy who went to church. But this guy was at least twice my age and tried to convince me to have sex with him. He also told me to stay quit and that if I tell he would get in trouble. I did not tell anyone until I was a teenager. I kept my mouth shut. And when I was caught with my pants around my ankles in front of the neighbor boy and his brother I was punished for it and they where not. Despite the older brother being almost a adult. So I know how it is. I know parents do not want to believe their child has been abused. Nobody wants to believe a child has been abused. But I can not let a child go through that. I can‚Äôt. If she was my child I would probably want to tear someone‚Äôs throat out honestly. My son is not even allowed to go near half my family. I gave up custody of him just so he was safe. I know even if someone seems to be a good person, and you love them they can still hurt you and still do bad things. I know from personal experience that some people will go to any length to lie and pretend they are not a bad person and predator. Because that is my aunt. Again sorry this was so long. I just want advise for advise. I know that is weird. But I am very emotional and I have a very hard time talking to people when I am emotional. I just want to know more about what he can do legally, and how he can protect this child. As his uncle I know he can legally act as a parent or guardian because I was raised by my aunt and uncle. I know he is a good man. His brother I do not know as well. But he has always been very good with my son, and my son calls him his uncle. I think the best option is for him to take over caring for the child honestly. If the mother is really a unfit parent as he says she is I think that is best. However I do not know if what he says is true, or just what his brother told him.  if it is then neither of the parents are suitable.  Because his brother is biased against woman, and he is raising a daughter. I do not see that being healthy for her growing up. And if he has sexually abused her then definitely not. Ugh! I am just so frustrated. Please help.', 'Lol! My dads name is Darryll spelled like that. He is for sure a redneck, and mountain man. So stop hating on my man Daryl.

The principles are the same, and I think it should actually be easier on a keyboard since it is basically a very long guitar fretboard that has the advantage that it can be pressed multiple places at once. \n\nI guess some differences are that the intervals on a guitar will always be the same no matter where/what key you play in, while on keyboard you have different color keys so it feels different from just moving everything up or down some frets,  you are limited to 6 strings at the time, and the posibilities are limited by the physique of the human hand. That maybe makes guitar less complicated, but still...\n\nWhy is this so hard for me? (Probably because I am not as smart/talented as I thought, but I honestly thought that being able to play guitar by ear would make piano come easey too). I am not even trying to play advanced stuff, just pop/rock songs from memory.']",F

(Does it even need to reach executive level when I'm not even in management?)\r\n\r\n* Can they reject my reason for resigning if it doesn't satisfy them? (Do I even need to explain it completely? Of course, I need to say something, but do I need to say everything?)\r\n\r\n* Can they say that I'm still involved in some big projects and can't leave until I finish them? (Even if there's someone I can turn them over to, in addition to the fact that my 1 month notice is exactly so that they can find a replacement?)\r\n\r\nTo make matters a bit worse, my team leader will be on leave when I give my 1 month notice, but he agreed to sign my letter before he flies (he's also cool with me quitting even if I'm his right hand man). I'm actually going to prepare 5 original copies each to be signed individually as opposed to photocopying. So, in addition to that, can they say that he needs to be here physically before I can resign, even if he's already read, approved, and signed my resignation letter?\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\nBig thanks in advance for any help.

MuchAdoAboutFutaloo,"[""personally I think almost everything on this is sick but in a little skeptical of the power of getting dex saving throw proficiency at level 7 in addition to a really fun and powerful utility support ability at the same level. it's on point flavor wise but the combo of this class's commanding movement power, damage output, and support options plus strength, con, and dex saving throws so soon is going to make you extremely hard to hit. especially with the +2 AC in an emergency from ribbon dance. I can't say I have a suggestion for another way to handle that ability, but I would reconsider it a bit.\n\nthe other complaint I have is you don't get an improvement to your own movespeed til much later in the class, and I think some kind of dance style that alters movespeed would be very on point and give some more fluidity to the capstone skill since most of the time it's gonna be open with fan, switch to saber, and then switch to ribbon when you're low or in trouble. I think having an option to buff your own mobility at 3 is perfectly on theme with the class and would be a lot of fun. my personal suggestion is, when wearing light armor, you get a bonus to your movespeed equal to 10ft x dex mod. scales as you level and fits the class. maybe 5ft if you're worried about it being too strong. \n\nmulticlassing is kind of a perpetual stain in balance so don't worry too much about this but I think some rogues may take this class up to level 3 just for saber dance if they're an archetype that doesn't get a way to trigger their own advantage like inquisitive.\n\notherwise, I really love this class and I'm gonna use it in my own games. this is badass and your flavor writing is really fun. the inclusion of support options with your teammates is something I frankly haven't been doing enough in my own work and I'm gonna keep an eye out for it from now on. awesome job!!!"", 'something with such broad appeal is naturally going to bring out the most simple and accessible content since that\'s what the most people can get on board with. it\'s even worse on younger demographic subs or y\'know, facebook etc. I just enjoy the different ""culture"" it provides, even if it\'s kind of stupid', ""hehe making me all giggly out here and shit thank yuo\n\nHey I don't know if it's weird to offer but I'm happy to help too???

He then asked my character exactly when she was born, which she didn\'t have on hand because she\'s not the sort to memorize things like that. I then returned the question to which he said he was born in ""The year the winter stayed long and the spring was short"", which is literally every year in canada. When I pointed this out in character he threatened to declare war on my entire clan and the prince had to shout us down to get us to stop.\r\n\r\nI\'ve since left for personal reasons but to my knowledge Fred\'s player was never given so much as a warning for his behavior because he was a founding member and the ST we were playing under refused to punish anyone who\'d been around longer than her for anything.\r\n\r\nEdit: Cease, this post does not deserve updoots.', ""Oh, right, my bad.

Especially a wrestlemania moment. Without them, it's difficult to do right and the energy is just gone. And it won't make much of a difference for the audience at home either. The ratings are on the decline across the board. Not nearly enough people will watch Drew's momentous win and thus not nearly enough will care. Not at Mania. Not on the Raw after. Or the Raw after that if things continue the way they are. \r\n\r\nDrew's victory over a big time player like Lesnar needs as many eyes on it as possible for it to resonate with the WWE fans. And Drew won't be getting that. This is not something that can go off half cocked. If Vince pulls the trigger on McIntyre, his reign is gonna be a flop. I'm certain everyone's on the same page with that. \r\n\r\nLesnar needs to win this. A hard fought, skin of his teeth win, but a win nonetheless. Let him need three or more F5s to win. Have the ref call a stoppage due to repeated elbows to the skull. Have Drew pass out in the kimura lock or the Brock lock. Have him get the win thanks to a top rope F5. Have Brock finally hit that shooting star press! Heck, we can even have the fight end in a draw with neither man able to answer a ten count. \r\n\r\nDrew is over enough that he can endure a loss and build himself back up. Have him win MiTB. Have him announce a cash in at SummerSlam or even the first show WWE has fans at. I know Vince and co. aren't great at thinking long term, but this is where they need to play the long game.

But I have a very hard time bonding with woman and being comfortable with them.  I often get told I act like a guy. And I don‚Äôt feel like a man. But I feel in the middle or like I switch. And often times I dress goth and present as feminine. But I shave part of my head and I do not act feminine often. I do not see why people care about my gender or sex. To me it is trivial. And in the end I am just gonna have feelings for someone based on who they are and not their bodies. Half of my family is anti lgbt. We don‚Äôt really talk. But I hope to meet my birth mom soon. And I am pretty sure she is accepting since she accepts my sister for being Bisexual. I also hope to come out to my son once he is old enough to understand. My question is what is the right age?

This would be my first formal project management job title, and I am trying to pin down what is appropriate to ask for in salary negotiations given the circumstances. I have no problem with being assertive if I am well informed, and I know I am the right candidate for the position, but as a mid-twenties female negotiating with an EVP who also knows my current job title and salary is basically that of an unofficial office manager, I want to have a solid understanding of what is fair to the market, and google research seems wildly all over the place.\n\nDetails:\n\nThe PM role is overseeing migration of our old flagship product to our new flagship product. I have experience working with PM and BPM in a leadership role at one of the Big Five tech giants in my last position, which included handling of onboarding and end-of-life service for multiple SaaS products, which is directly applicable. \n\nI have 18 months of established expertise and relationships at this company working directly with both our old and new products, our IT teams, and our clients in the field. No one else in the company has this hands-on experience with both. I have glowing reviews from both teams. \n\nBecause I have worked with both I know that both teams are frustrated, the migration is going poorly, and both IT and the field feel that leadership is not listening to complaints about flaws with the new product because they have already sunk so many millions into this new product. This product line is the only profitable arm of the company this year so far, and instability with the new product risks losing some of our biggest clients. This makes the political situation of the position very tense and high profile.\n\nI do not have a PMP as I have not been able to get the formal hours to qualify yet. I do not have a degree in IT or Tech, just a history with translating engineers to higher leadership and field reps. I accepted my current position at $50K, which was higher than advertised but I was able to negotiate due to a competing offer to return to the big five for another contract at a higher rate. I‚Äôve since received a raise putting me at $52K now, which is still less than I received at the Big Five.\n\nI am hoping to wait for an offer from the EVP before beginning negotiations, but I have no idea what is fair given my combo of unique skill sets and experience. I am hoping to set a minimum of $80K to accept, given the scope and profile of the project, but higher averages on this form of PM position online seem to range from $90k-$120k. \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.', ""I really do want to leave my contracting company, but in the Seattle area where I work they pretty much dominate the workforce if you don't have 10 plus years of experience in your field."", ""At a BDSM party at a sex club/community center.

Instead it just calls the new UCN version of writeFlag.\r\n\r\nSince the code hasn‚Äôt been shared, I can‚Äôt confirm 100% that this is the case, but it is extraordinarily unlikely to be a bug - it would require a huge degree of negligence in writing code, and you would expect to see other, more serious bugs if that was the case (stuff like file saves going missing.) \r\n\r\nHowever, I strongly suspect it‚Äôs meant as a fun Easter Egg and not anything deeply lore relevant. At most, it‚Äôs an indication that what happens in the main canon can affect FNAF World‚Äôs ‚Äúflipside‚Äù - which was already indicated in FNAF World anyways - and if you really stretch it that UCN exists somewhere in the space between the Flipside and the Real World. Although it‚Äôs fun to theorize FNAF World is heaven for animatronics and there‚Äôs a portal to UCN there so they can fuck up William at their leisure :p', '3D printed a virtual pet case!

ZeroReverseR1,"['Level Eater: A Short Idea on a Possible Errata \n <HEADING> Foreword\r\n\r\nJust to get it out of the way, I\'m well aware of how Level Eater can be abused in the Link Format, since you can have a LV5+ sugar daddy for it to feed off of and keep coming back as material. I also wanna mention that I <ITALIC> don\'t run (nor need to run) Level Eater in any of my current decks, so I\'m not really desperate to be able to use it again.\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Background\r\n\r\nSo I found myself thinking about how this little bug boi could come off the banlist, and seeing how Links have made their mark in the game, an errata is going to be inevitable if there\'s any hope for it to be legal again without breaking things. Doesn\'t help LV5+ monsters are much easier to bring than ever before, so you\'ll almost always have something for it to bite from.\r\n\r\nOf course, erratas are usually frowned upon for a variety of reasons. Some have been changed/nerfed so much that they\'ve lost what made them them (e.g. Dark Strike Fighter), with some saying they should\'ve just stayed banned at full power rather than defeat the purpose of them coming back out as a shadow of their former selves. There\'s also the fact that older versions of the card, especially for more significant effect changes (e.g. Sangan being HOPT), may not be usable in less casual events.\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Idea\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I was thinking if Level Eater could be errata\'d to simply be unusable as Link Material if summoned by its own effect. Yes, it kills interaction with the modern format, but it does prevent the possible abuse without affecting the way it\'s been used before.\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Problems\r\n\r\nDark Synchro: Thought I forgot they existed, huh? I\'m aware they\'re part of the reason Level Eater got banned due to allowing for Omega loops and ending on a board full of Quasars/Blazars, since I used to play a little bit of Dark Synchros way back when myself, though I know not all variants required Level Eater. What I don\'t know is if they can still blow off even in the Link Format (never tried), and with almost every other combo piece also hit (Gofu, Omega, etc.).\r\n\r\nFuture Proofing: Of course, this errata would only help solve Link abuse, and would make it very obvious why they banned and errata\'d it (it\'s like if Yata Garasu got errata\'d to specifically say ""cannot be used if you activated the effect of Chaos Emperor Dragon this turn""). If Konami introduces another summoning method or gimmick where the great minds of the community could find ways to abuse the poor insect, then that\'s a whole other story.\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Possible Alternatives\r\n\r\nThere are some other, albeit worse, ideas I had in mind that could happen:\r\n\r\n* Not usable as Link Material <BOLD> at all, even if not summoned by its own effect\r\n\r\n* Banished when it leaves the field after using its effect\r\n\r\n* Once per Turn (Hard or Soft)\r\n\r\n* Can\'t bite from the same monster more than once\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Going Forward\r\n\r\nThis got me thinking about future erratas, not just Level Eater\'s, and how they could be handled better. Of course, it won\'t be applicable to all cards currently on the list, as there are definitely some that\'ll require heavier changes, but I\'m sure there are ways for others that let them keep the full power they had during their time without completely tipping the scales of the modern format.\r\n\r\n<ITALIC> _\r\n\r\n<HEADING> Discussion\r\n\r\nSo, what does everyone else think? Would you be fine if the errata was just that (or would it even solve the problem), or would you rather it stay untouched? Would you want other cards to be errata\'d provided they don\'t butcher the effect but still keep it from being abused somehow?\r\n\r\nAlso, any problems I failed to consider with Level Eater\'s hypothetical return, or reasons why it was banned that I missed? I\'m sure there are some since I\'m not too well-versed on maintaining format health and whatnot. Maybe no one else even misses/wants Level Eater to come back, I dunno.', 'Executor suffers an identity crisis so hard he just blows up.', ""Definitely interesting that DLM still holds Crystrons in such high regard. I love them and play them exclusively, don't get me wrong, but while I do agree their ceiling hasn't changed, I feel like Tier 2 is the best spot for them. Either because I don't think they're super strong, or because I don't want them to be in the spotlight for Konami to hit.\r\n\r\nI do agree that the worst that's happened is the loss of semi-limited cards like World Legacy Clash and E-Con, and that can be worked around relatively easily with other techs (good thing I got Machina Fortress before since I had a feeling I might need it one day in Crystrons). Losing 1 Rion makes little difference since you can just add 1 more Citree now that NMCR's been nerfed. I might also consider Cosmic Cyclone now since I'm expecting to see a rise in AFD>Necrovalley users.\r\n\r\nThe hit to TC does kinda suck for the consistency, but Undine acts as a substitute, and since you were already playing 1-2 garnets in the form of the Crystal Beasts, playing 1-2 Controllers makes little difference.\r\n\r\nQuestion now is the Skill; Tunermorph and the Level Changing skills are tempting and can lead to some spicy plays, but I was also thinking about more offensive Skills like Beatdown or The Tie That Binds. WLC really helped against big beaters like Sabre Dancer without needing to do the Ametrix/Impact play, and losing it means I might struggle a bit more against raw attack."", 'While I too hate NMCR and want it to be nerfed, I personally don\'t think it\'s cheating or anything. Maybe it is abusing poor design choice by the devs, but for me, even if I don\'t use it (I don\'t even have it), anything <ITALIC> in the game is fair game (not <ITALIC> fair fair, but ""it\'s not hacking"" fair). And this is as someone who plays Crystrons exclusively.\r\n\r\nFunnily enough, I have a good record against NMCR users because they rely so heavily on it, DM players even CC\'ing their own Circle because I didn\'t set any backrow, which ends up hurting them more since I went for the Rion-banish setup rather than Citree-GY.\r\n\r\nOf course, I can\'t say the same for every deck, and some get totally shut down harder than Crystrons because they don\'t have alternative plays, which will definitely seem more unfair to them. Again, I still do think it should get nerfed and agree with you completely in that regard, but I also believe there are ways to play around it as of now.']",M
